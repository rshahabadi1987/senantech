2017,13-06-2017,2,0,5, Purchased 2017 Titan Pro X after looking at all of the other 1/2 ton trucks and loving it sofar!  I have towed a 7000 lb travel trailer without issue and the truck is great to drive.  Love the sound of the V8 but wish it got a bit better mileage.,
2017,20-02-2017,1,0.9359,5, I purchased a Titan in November 2016 after years of wanting to buy a pickup truck. There was a great deal of time spent comparing the features specs prices etc. of all full size and midsize pickups on the market. I also test drove many of these pickups but wanted to wait until the new Titan arrived before making the decision.  After a test drive of the Titan I was quite impressed with the performance features and overall value. Within a week of the test drive I bought one. The Titan comfortably accommodates my family of five and our gear for extended road trips. It cruises down the interstate with no effort and handles snow and mud without issue. It is a very thoughtfully designed vehicle and I hope it is as reliable as previous Nissan vehicles my family has owned. If I had to buy it again I would!,
2010,15-09-2010,3,0.9651,5, This is my first Z since high school.  Traded in my S Class Mercedes.  Love the fun of it and hopefully will continue to adjust to the road noise and sports car ride.  That being said like others backing up and changing lanes is an adventure.  All the controls are at your fingertips and very comfortable seats.  My husband is 6 ft. 5 in. so not for him but it's mine anyway.,
2010,09-09-2010,3,0.8536,5,All interior components.  Stylish looks,
2010,03-09-2010,3,0,5,Back up mirror a must,
2010,11-08-2010,3,0,5, This is my first Z.  It reminds me of an earlier generation Porsche 911.  It's a Touring coupe with Sports Package and Nav package. Tremendous roadability and handling with wonderful manual 6-speed tranny decent power and beautiful dynamics +++ fun factor. It's more of an eye-turner than my Porsche Turbo S cab.  Only dislike is the exhaust note and slow initial climb to higher RPM. ,
2010,05-08-2010,3,0.8481,5,Interior and exterior styling and engineering are exemplary. The Z is at the top of favorite vehicles I have owned (mostly Porsche). Ergonomics and six-speed transmission are stand outs!,
2014,25-07-2013,3,0.6239,5, We got our blue Versa Note on 7-12-13. I have to say we did a lot of research on this vehicle and others Honda Fit Hyundai Elantra etc. what drove us to the new note was it's,
2014,27-07-2014,3,0.3612,5,claim on fuel economy.,
2014,11-12-2013,4,0,4,Well after driving it for almost 2 weeks now I can say that there fuel economy rating is pretty spot on we are getting 34 in the city and the few times that it has been on the highway we are getting 42 on the highway. I am quite impressed with that. It has a nice quite ride for a car of its size also. The exterior is stylish but the interior is the same as the versa sedan which bland. But the controls are all easy to get to and work well the back up camera is quite handy. Updates coming. 7-25-16  Now that we have had it for just over 3 years I have to say it is good for an around town car lots of little shakes and noises from the dash. It is a cheap car and that reflects with the interior componets. Fuel economy is still very good overall getting 36.5 mpg. It is definitely not meant for cold and snow starts good warms up slow.  As for the summer it will take it 30 miles to cool the car down it has a very weak climate control system you have to turn up the fan all the way to 4 just to feel some air whether it is hot or cold  and it is very noisy. Overall a good commuter car as for taking on long trips be prepared for back aches.  Would not buy it again or recommend to others has kinda soured me on purchasing another make of Nissan as I am afraid they will be the same for the heating and cooling part of it.,
2014,28-06-2013,2,0.9862,4.875," We say ""surprisingly good"" because if one read all the negative reviews...well you get the idea.",
2014,03-01-2014,1,-0.5719,4.5, Note's MPG with usually two aboard and under all conditions including steep hills and a couple of mountains is astonishing at 40+ mpg average. ,
2010,01-08-2010,3,0.0258,4.375, Wow first two seater but I have had powerful cars before.  Great handling can't believe how well it corners.  Strong motor very linear response. Fun factor off the charts.  Very impressed with the styling especially how I see the original Z in this model.  Pictures don't do it justice.  Got the Black Cherry Paint in the Base sport model but went in to buy the 40th edition Touring Sprt.  When I saw this color I decided I didn't need the touring package.  Synchro-rev match is pretty cool stuff but the motor is the real gem,
2010,22-06-2010,2,0.9861,4.625,"Styling Motor synchro-rev match.  Getting leather seats installed.  transmission is nice. Push button start.  19"" wheels are very stylish for factory wheels.",
2010,16-06-2010,2,0.4215,5,Better exhaust note.  Very disappointing.  mY FX 35 sounded way cooler.  Road noise.  Depending on the road surface it can be a roar.  Back up camera would be great.  Had one on my FX and it was the bomb.  With the blind spots on this car it is almost a requirement.,
2010,21-05-2010,2,0.5584,4.875," I traded my '06 350z roadster on this '10 370z roadster. I loved the 350. But this 370 is fabulous. Taking all the other reviews into account throwing out the 63"" guy who is not happy w/ the room not a surprise I agree w/ all the good words. My wife and I love the car! The only complaint is the way too quiet and innocuous exhaust note. The same was said wrt the 350. Didn't the designers read any reviews at all? Not smart. As for road noise I don't find it all that bad even w/ the 19"" wheels etc. Of course mine is the convertible not the coupe which I can understand would be a lot noisier for sure. ",
2010,27-04-2010,2,0.7827,4.875,Looks and comfort and performance all around go/stop/steering/turning. Great! Thrilling! Wife loves the Black Cherry paint and the bells and whistles. ,

2008,31-10-2016,4,0,3, I love how the car is smooth for the most part. Slower acceleration than some cars then again it isn't a sports car nor is the road a race track! It keeps up with fast highway traffic -140 max and on the one way roads it is small enough to squeeze on the side when passing other cars as opposed to most cars. Engine can be a bit noisy at times but it is def. not loud when driving at high speeds like a lot of other cars including luxury cars like those buzzing sounds. In all fairness to this car which I read a lot of minor or just plain stupid comments about the car is an amazing one for the price performance and overall quality! (*It also depends on the driver and how s/he drives & car).,
2008,29-07-2016,3,0.873,4,Having paid $11000ish for car & $14000 otd great deal.

Versa>Yaris>Cobalt,
2008,17-11-2015,4,0.6249,1, I bought this car new in 2008. I do all smooth country road driving and very little city driving.  After 80000 miles until now with 122000 miles I have had to replace the rocker arm (cracked at 80000 miles) new muffler (hole from corrosion at 80000) front coil spring broke just sitting in the parking lot (110000 miles - now they just put a recall on that which entails Nissan taking off my much thicker new springs and replacing it with their's if I want my $1200 back that I had to payout.) my passenger handle paint is bubbling off driver door handle sticks in the summer time (it won't spring back when pulled) have to replace the hood latch under the hood now because it won't close after numerous times of even praying lubricant on it back seat wouldn't go down until I had to lubricant that to death and many more little crap!  I have never had a vehicle with so many problems that shouldn't be a problem until 200000 miles.  I can't change my own plugs... Because you have to drain the antifreeze to take off a cover to get to the ,4 plug.  AVOID ALL VERSA'S! Neighbors have a 2011 and 2013... Nothing but problems for them also.
2008,25-12-2011,4,-0.8175,2.625, The build quality of this car is really poor the lens of the transmission console fell off (?) the front driver side splash guard came off on the road the decorative cover of the driver side door lock came off for no reason and the entire exterior door,
2008,02-01-2012,1,-0.6801,3.375,handle itself came fell off a few months later. These are items that hardly ever break down on any car. I addition I had to replace oxygen sensors at just 50 K miles and exhaust pipe at just 56 K miles. After being a loyal Nissan customer (I owned Stanza Quest and Sentra in the past) I will never buy a Nissan again. I wonder what happened to the Nissan quality...it is not there anymore.,
2008,25-11-2011,4,0.2263,4.625,None,
2008,12-10-2011,4,0,2,Carry out an entire review of assembly line procedures improve workmanship quality,
2008,05-05-2013,2,0.4404,5, I have read these reviews and I have to wonder if the people that have had alignment problems are just hitting too many potholes. ,
2008,05-04-2011,2,-0.4019,4.625,I have over 70k on my car and have only had one alignment and I know it was due to the terrain.,
2008,25-04-2016,2,0,3,Nothing flimsy about this car. It's been an excellent car I drive a lot and I highly recommend it. ,
2008,26-05-2013,2,0.7574,4.75,It's held up extremely well no mechanical problems at all. I think it's all in how you drive. ,
2008,03-01-2011,1,-0.4186,4.625, Overall I have been very happy with the car. It handles well is easy to drive and has a lot of interior room and comfort. Good value too. The one caveat is that my transmission failed after 40000. It was replaced under warranty with no problems. I am not sure how common this is or if I was just unlucky. Since the replacement transmission was installed the car has run great. The gas mileage estimates are not as high as stated by Nissan.,
2008,14-06-2012,2,0.8941,2.625, Yes I'm the fool. I wish I could go back and get the Honda Fit I originally wanted but didn't get b/c Honda wouldn't come off $1000 from the price. I purchased the 2008 Nissan Versa and have hated it from the 1st week of ownership. 64000 miles and the windows won't go up and down smoothly When accelerating going up an entry ramp to the hwy I lose MPH and the RPM's redline. I have to pull over on the shoulder of the highway at 5:00pm traffic put it in park then back to drive to reset it. Only to have it happen again going up a hill slowly. Sometime I have to push the petal to the metal (floorboard) just to get it to move! And the steering wheel gets loosey goosey when I lose the MPH's.,
2008,29-11-2011,4,-0.9134,4.75,NONE-  Gas mileage is worse than husbands Ford 500!!! ,

2008,06-07-2010,3,0.6996,4.125,We took a family of 4 on a weeklong beach trip (10 hours one way drive).,
2007,10-10-2006,4,0,4.875, I really like this car.  I drove a similar but smaller model in Spain and was thrilled to see that Nissan was putting out a subcompact in the USA.  I was looking for a car that rode a little higher than the average sedan but still got good gas mileage and didn't cost too much.  I got all those things in the Versa and I haven't been disappointed in any of its quirks (e.g. audible shifting noises loose handling flimsy velcro attachment for the hatch cover).  Plus I love the upholstery (microfibery) the tire pressure monitoring system the touch- sensitive hatch lifter and the interior room with an adorable easy to park exterior.  ,

2007,12-05-2011,2,0.3597,2.125, I took my 2005 Nissan Sentra 1.8 in for warranty service (rear brake drums needed replaced at 8563 miles! =( ) and walked over to the showroom while waiting for my car to be worked on.  I took a test drive of the new Versa and fell in love!  I brought my new Versa home last night and can't wait to get in it and drive some more!  The shifter takes some getting used to as I have only ever driven a standard-H pattern manual before but it's so much fun!  My children have more room in the backseat now and the seats are very cushy and comfy!  I had to go with a lower model - no cruise control like I had in the Sentra - but since I hardly used it anyway no major loss!  Great job Nissan!,

2007,05-01-2014,1,0,4.375, My 2007 Versa ran like a champ until 4-6 months ago when suddenly while driving would feel as if the car was not responding or had changed gears by itself.,

1991,10-03-2005,1,0.4767,4.625, I bought this car used in 2003 for $3200 with 139000 on it. I put $1000 in it for a timing chain thermostat H20 pump etc. Since then I have put 20000 miles on the car and have had to replace the alternator and the master cylinder. Total cost $450.00.

Rust is just now beginning to creep around inside the wheel wells and one rear door (Wisconsin winter salt).  Only maintenance in 4+ years and 57000 miles is alternator distributor cap.  Routine repairs of timing belt and water pump exhaust brakes tires cv boots ft suspension ball joints.,
1991,28-06-2007,2,0.6997,4.625,Bose stereo in this car is awesome.  I'm not a big Bose fan for home stereo but its great in this car.  Styling is cool - enough angles so it doesn't look like an egg like the newer Maxima's.  Very few squeeks / rattles.,
1991,22-07-2004,3,0.746,5,Sport suspension transmits expansion cracks harshly.  Little too much body roll in corners.  Cup holders needed.  Fold down rear seat needed.  SE multi-valve engine and its 30 extra hp not available until 1992.,
1991,28-02-2005,1,0,5, I got this car about 2 years ago and it is great. Even after 16 years it still gets good gas mileage.The transmission blew at 160k got it fixed. Replaced the timing belt at 180K. But i can't beleive it came without a single cupholder. Still going strong at over 185k and i plan to keep it another year. It can still get up over 85+ MPH.,

1990,11-06-2007,2,0,4.25, I bought this car in Nashville and drove it up to Michigan and love it!  Totally reliable and always ready to give.  I've replaced the starter and the alternator and a few minor things but that's it!  It currently has 168000 miles on it and there's no sign of slowing down.  It's not an eye catcher but anything that pays me to drive it who cares!  Wonderful investment and I'll most likely drive it into the ground.,

1990,19-02-2013,1,0.5106,4.25, I bought this car back in 2001 for $1500. It had 123000 miles in it. The interior and exterior were both in excellent condition. I had to do minimal maintenance to get the car up to par.,
1990,19-03-2002,1,0.5719,4.5,Throughout the 12 years I owned it I did just regular maintenance. Tires tune up brakes fluid changes ect. Not until I got to around 200000 miles did major repairs needed I replaced the automatic transmission with a used one and then replaced all the fuel injectors (only needed 2). This car has been a godsend,
1990,18-01-2003,1,0.5859,5,It still drives just as good as the day I bought it even better with the new injectors. Has plenty of power handles well and it's still easy on the eyes. ,
1990,07-03-2002,1,0.8689,4.75,I love the leg and head room of this car. I'm 6 foot and its nice and comfortable for long trips. It's quite on the highway with a nice set of tires and can cruise at 90mpg. Simple dash cluster sturdy design. Well built car. ,
1990,24-06-2007,2,0.9349,4.875,The only reason I sold this car because of gas prices going up. It's not the most fuel efficient on the road. Otherwise I would have drove it into the ground if I could. I sold it with 229000 miles and it was still in perfect running condition. Did an emissions test right before I sold it and it was actually burning cleaner than the day I bought it 12 earlier. ,
1990,21-09-2005,3,0.8166,5, I have owned my 1990 Nissan Maxima SE since my sophomore year in college.  This car excelled performance wise for 4 yrs in the mountains of Colorado.  The car always started and heated up quiclky in the sub zero temps in Minnesota for 4 years.  For the past 7 yrs the car has done great in FL the A/C always cooling down.  The Maxima is a great quality car that will keep on running.  The engine is great and the interior has held up very well.  Highly recomended.   ,

2014,21-02-2015,1,0,1.625, I purchased this van after a bit of research. Every car has a few people that can't be made happy. I now have 17000 miles and bald tires. I didn't think much of it until I tried to buy new ones. Nissan dealers have the only load rated tires in the required size and they are quite proud of them. I discussed changing wheel size with my service advisor and any modification would void my warranty. $100/month for tires. The interior heat and air are very weak. The engine performance seemed good enough at test drive but try carrying a light load and it is painfully if not dangerously slow. ,
2014,30-04-2016,2,-0.3246,4,Love the technology package and GPS. The radio is decent for a cargo van. ,
2014,30-10-2015,4,0.6369,3,Honestly nearly everything on this van is seriously under built for cargo use. ,
2013,02-09-2016,3,0.3182,4, Lowest floor height makes lifting and loading easy (for the  elderly).  Purchased exclusively for that feature. Confirm that tire life is VERY short (20-23000 miles).  There tires by others that meet Nissan specs for less money. Paid independent specialty alignment shop to electronically check alignment and found (as others have) that there is a misalignment in the rear wheels and in their opinion the alignment is contributing to premature tire wear. Will address to Nissan dealership but specialty shop could not identify any means to adjust rear alignment. Checked for a competitive brand to extend tire life but nothing beats the loading height of the NV 200. As a light load low mileage user I still know that for my need I can find NOTHING BETTER!,
2013,10-08-2013,3,0.7809,4.75, Yes it only has a little over 100 miles but after comparison to the Transit Connect I decided to bring one home today. Better fit and finish better ride and handling and priced less with the options. It is a peppy little van and it is deceivingly quick with CVT transmission. It doesn't seem quick but it pulls like an electric car no shifting!. We got 30 mpg average on the trip home with A/C on and a 2000 foot elevation gain in 75 miles. I will update in a few weeks. ,
2013,23-04-2014,2,0.9592,5,The tech. package is a must have and Ford offers.....something that seems about 10 years old. Very comfortable and attractive interior. Traction control. People think it is odd looking...excellent because I want my business vehicle to be noticed!!! It will be. Oh yah... inside cargo racks come with it. ,
2013,24-09-2015,3,0.7672,5,None so far. ,
2013,17-12-2014,4,0,2.875, I purchased this vehicle for my business Oct 2013 and could not be happier. Bought fully loaded SV with all options. I have been using full size Ford and Chevy vans for over 20 yrs in auto glass trade and the Nissan's tall interior height combined with low floor make life much easier on the back. Averaging 25 mpg mixed and hitting 32 highway regularly. CVT transmission is very smooth and vehicle is sporty to drive around with little bit wider tire/rim combo 205/55/16. Factory headlights are plenty bright and wideHID conversion not needed. Fairly quiet ride for cargo van. Great view of road especially out side glass compared Transit with 2 piece side with bar.,
2013,12-01-2015,1,0.7117,2,Interior mounting points for shelving system is smart and Adrian steel partition and shelves are perfectly designed for this vehicle to give maximum protection while maintaining max cargo space compared to Transits design. Nav/bluetooth/back up camera unit nice touch along with power window and door locks/alarm. Drivers seat firm but comfortable for several hundred mile days. Pass seat worktable feature along with center file storage and dash storage. Very well thought out for business use.,
1993,30-07-2009,3,0.9168,4.75, I bought this van with 125000km on it about 2002 or so. I now have 400000km on it in 2009 and it continues to still run strong. Replace the usual brakes and shocks twice. Luckily the engine studs were done before I bought it. Lately it has some engine hesitation and starts on the second try. Not figured that out yet. Anybody have any ideas?,

2013,07-03-2013,1,0.6249,4.125, With the expected arrival of our 6th child our Toyota Sienna minivan was going to be too small for our needs. The thought of diving a huge 12-passenger van did not appeal to us. The choices for a long time have pretty much been either Ford or Chevy which have limited features and the Mercedes van while nice is just too expensive. So we were very pleased to learn that Nissan has started selling 12-passenger vans at about the same price as the Ford and Chevy vans. When we saw all the options available on the NV we started to get more excited about it. And after about 2200 miles we've been very pleased with it. It drives surprisingly well for a large van. I highly recommend the NV.,
1993,24-02-2010,1,0.9677,3.125, The vehicle has been reliable and it did not fail to start/run even in minus 40-50 Celsius!  I will be sad to let her go because we're getting another vehicle.,

Point is: your satisfaction depends on what you're used to and how much you expect for $13000 or so. For the money I think the Versa is a steal compared to what's out there. It's roomy comfortable peppy good gas mileage (average 33mpg) quiet ride good suspension cute and it's NEW! I never realized how bad my headlights and windshield wipers were on the old car! I also never had a CD player so you see I'm not hard to please! I would never spend what most new cars cost so I'm very happy with my Versa.,

Drives like a car. Excellent performance and fuel economy on the highway (@55mph). Clean easy to read dash. It only has minor leaks (expected). Body still in great shape.

Interior has held up awesome with little to no wear to the seats. Still getting great gas mileage and no oil burning. This car deserves respect for being so simple in its design and so amazingly well built. I can't understand why they still can't produce all cars to be this well. So anyone looking for a great second or student car this is it hands down! Hope to get million km out of her yet. My little red rocket just goes and goes.,

I get about 34 mpg highway and 28 mpg city.   The car is very reliable and a real do-it-yourself car when it comes to maintenance.  I changed the alternator and thermostat myself in addition to the plugs.  The timing chain is fine just as long as you keep the oil changed on a regular basis.  I still have the car but I just use it as a road runner now.  I went out and bought a Nissan Frontier and it is just as reliable.,

2014,30-09-2015,3,0.6249,5, The Note is pretty good considering it is one of the cheapest cars you can buy new at the moment. Manual windows locks pretty much everything besides the side mirrors is manual. The interior is very cheap and plastic feeling. At the same time however the interior is simple and easy to navigate. The back seats have some of the best space for any small car on the market. You can easily fit two 300+lbs 6 foot high people in the back with no problem. The 1.8L motor does the job just fine producing 109HP. It isn't very quick but I have yet to have any problems merging onto the highway or driving on any road. I'm happy with this purchase.,

2014,18-09-2013,3,-0.2755,4.125, This is our 14th Datsun/Nissan vehicle and fourth in the Versa family. The Note is our first non-manual transmission vehicle and the CVT performs very well. From cruising the highways in PA to the need for quick merges into heavy traffic in DC and NJ the power train hasn't let us down. The Note is just a touch smaller inside than our Versa hatchback but still very roomy and rear seat passengers are always surprised by the generous legroom even with the front seats all the way back. With a fifth passenger the back is a little tight side to side but that come with the territory. My wife commutes an hour to work and we make frequent 3-4 hour drives on our travels and the ride comfort is great never feeling cramped. We've been spoiled by the XM radio. Fuel economy is very good and we didn't have to pay any premium for a hybrid. Solid reliable transportation that won't break your budget.,
2014,05-09-2015,3,0.9735,5,"4/14/16 Update: No real changes in opinion on anything. Since we're at 60000 miles and after a talk with the service manager to inquire about whether a transmission flush on the CVT is recommended at 60K (it is) we're having that done tomorrow. They tell me it's called a ""drain down"" because with the CVT they don't drain all the fluid out because of how the transmission is built. Not having any issues with the CVT that I can tell although we've been driving manual transmissions so long that this is still a bit outside of my experience. Late winter we had a transmission reprogram done on a recall which actually bumped up the mileage a bit but didn't seem to change how it feels at all. Getting 41-42 mpg combined driving at the moment. We're going to Indy for the race this year so that will be the next long road trip to check highway mpg.",

2014,17-11-2015,4,0.85,4, So I bought this car as a commuter. Currently have 45000 brutal miles on her.  I drive 100 mile round trip to work over Donner Summit in the Sierra Nevada's of Northern California. (Ever heard of the Donner Party) It's a 5000 foot elevation gain from my house to work. The car during the very steep sections noticeably struggles. About 4k rpm's during the steep sections. Fuel economy suffers also while driving up the summit. But let's be realistic. I spent $13500 out the door for this car. For the price I am more than happy with its performance. I hate it when people compare a $13k car to some other $30k+ car. ,

I have been very disappointed with my 2009 370Z Car because you can't drive it over 4000 RPM's if the ambient temperature is over 90 degrees. As a result I only have 630 miles on my 370Z!  The 370Z Car without an engine oil cooler will over-heat! The engine oil temperature reaches 280 degrees if the ambient temperature is over 90 degrees and it will do it in a very short period of time.  When this happens the car's engine RPM's are reduced from 7500 RPM's to 6500 RPM's and if the engine oil temperature reaches 290 degrees the engine's RPM's will be reduced to 4500 RPM's which is approximately half of the 370Z Horsepower!,

2009,09-10-2009,4,-0.4532,4.125, My previous autos were an 08 TL TypeS an 06 Vette and an 05 Charger Daytona. I know performance and quality. The 370Z has more of both than any of my previous vehicles. She's perfect for hotrodding around town and a great interstate cruiser at 79mph (yep in the summer). I ledfoot it all the time and have never seen my oil temp gauge above 225(& I live in Central Georgia). Build quality and finish are outstanding. Heat isn't an issue unless you take it to the track. And if you intend to at its price point what's the big deal about putting an oil cooler on it? Worried about warranty? Don't race the car! After 14000 troublefree mi the car is simply without peer cost/value/performance. ,
2009,13-07-2009,3,0.9053,4.5,Crazy fast corners like it's on rails; yet has interior quality and exterior fit and finish that shame both my '08 Acura TL TypeS and '06 Vette.,
2009,03-06-2010,2,-0.128,5, Wow this car just getting lots of looks wherever I go After driving SUVs (automatic) in the last 19 years it's time for me to get the driving-fun back in my life. I can't stop grinning every time I sit on my 370z  I had been in the market for a sports car and I was considering the Gen Coupe oh Boy I'm glad I went for the Z. I got a great deal ($1000 below invoice) and the APR I want. Syncro Rev match really helps you if you are a novice driver. Best bang for your buck in terms of performance and handling for a sports car.,
2009,11-05-2010,2,0.9588,4.625,The Exterior Styling is unlike anything you see on the road it just plain gorgeous. First ever Synchro Rev Match on the manual,

2009,17-04-2010,2,0,4.75, I had the the 350Z roadster. Loved the top down. For 5 years. The 370Z is all new inspired by the 350.  Goes and looks right in every way. I have the touring and sport pkg 6 spd. Corners and pulls off the line as promised. Rear wheel wells are noisy in the rain-road noise. The value of the car verses what you pay overrides noisy tires. Wind it out or turn up your iPod. No noise. It's all true. The car is a fantastic 2 seater to be respected.,

2009,29-05-2010,2,0,4.75," My first car was 72 240z and I had an 83 280ZX. The 370 is the best yet. It is quick and nimble. You rarely have to plan your moves in traffic just look for an open spot and the Z will be there. People complain that the gearshift is ""notchy"" I am not sure what that means? I find it quick and accurate. People complain about road noise. It is a two seater sports coupe. You expect a little road noise. You might try learning to judge the character of the road surface from the sound. Most of all this car is just fun to drive. I commute 90 min each way daily. In the Z I actually look forward to the drive. The seats are so comfortable. They actually get more comfortable the longer you sit in them.",
2009,09-03-2010,1,0.9005,4.375,It is fun to drive. People notice it where ever I go. If I see two a week that's a lot and I live in L.A. Handling breaking and performance. Good sound system and just the right amount of road noise. Nice interior a definite step up for Z-Car interiors.,
2009,27-12-2009,4,0.8779,5,I wish the ventilation system worked better. The A/C always comes on and you have to switch it off. (I just want fresh air). Recirc won't run without the A/C period. Switch off the A/C and Recirc cuts off. After about an hour the fresh air starts getting warmer and warmer. I just want fresh cool air,
2009,15-12-2009,4,0.9393,4.625, Fun to drive awesome acceleration eye candy.  Getting in and out takes getting used to. Be aware of blind spots and limited rear view visibility. Bucket seats somewhat uncomfortable the raised sides excessively squeeze my legs I am only 170lb so I can only imagine how uncomfortable that might feel for someone of a bigger posture.

2009,23-03-2010,1,0.765,4.75, I have had this car on the track and it also is my daily commuter car. I just love it. Everything they say about the car is true - road noise loud very stiff kidney shaker stripped down etc..... and it is exactly as advertised. If you want a track car that looks great and fun to drive then this car is for you. If you want seat warmers GPS BOSE system all the creature comforts - stick with the regular 370Z with the sports package.  Just my 2 cents worth.,

2009,27-07-2014,3,0,4.625, I'm 55 and bought a black on black. Just awesome under cover for Winter. Pull it out run the engine. Just not enough. Need Spring. Ive never had so much anticipation to drive it again. Love the exterior. A head turner. Interior has a modern quality cockpit feel. Seat comfort good and grows on you to now it is just very comfortable no problem. Performance is off the charts. Power turning braking and cruising excellent . I have 18inch wheels and never even thought about any road noise. I have the basic sound system and its very good. May upgrade though because I love my music.Not necessary though. Can't say enough> I've never loved a car so much.,

Goodyear tires bought the more expensive tires after replacing them after 2 years because we wanted them to last!!  Also have had rust problems air leaking threw the doors.. had to be fixed twice still Air sound...,
2016,20-10-2016,4,-0.6351,5, I am very happy with my purchase! I am not a minivan person but I cant find a good excuse to get a different vehicle very good acceleration good gas mileage for its size and practicality. Sometimes I forget that I am driving a minivan and drive like in a sporty vehicle because it handles very well.,
2016,12-10-2016,4,-0.5371,3," Our family and relatives all drive different minivan over the past 20 years.  From Dodge Caravan and Town and Country Ford Aerostar and Windstar Honda Odyssey Totoya Pervia and sienna I have tried many of them.  Overall this Nissan Quest the driver seats and 2nd row seats are great.  It is compatible to Honda Odyssey and Sienna.  In fact I like the driver seat and front panel design more that Honda and Toyota.   However from practical purpose the 3rd row seat's leg room just too small comparing to Honda and Toyota.   An average 5' 7"" tall adult's knee will touch the back of the 2nd row.   That's the main reason we didn't buy the Quest.",
1992,26-02-2007,1,0.765,3.625, I must have gotten the lemon version after reading all the great reviews. I bought the car with about 107k miles. after the 1st yr the trans went out. Spent 2K expecting this to be the last major problem. Took it back to trans shop 4 times. After an 8 month good run trans went again. Now trans is out of warranty. I have also replaced all fuel injectors. Thank God I learned how to replace the injectors myself.  They kept going 1 after another. After the injectors were all replaced what an improvement in the performance! but just when I thought I was on my way to a good experience the Trans failed again! Hopefully you will have a better experience than I did. In 50K miles spent around $4K ,

Ive had to replace a set of tires the radiator the battery and now a minor oil leak. Sounds bad but it's a used car and was more than likely its timing. With that being said I love this car. Ive thought about a new car but when I look around I compare other cars to my Maxima.  Mine is a beautiful color (bluish) with leather seats that are in terrific condition 6-disc CD player (that needs replacing bc the factory one is crappy) and a sunroof. No leaks. Keyless entry.

This is the last year they made this body style and I like it almost more than the 2004-2006 models.  Nissans run on a timing chain too which eases some concerns as to when you need to replace your timing belt.  Love it.  I can only say positive things about it other than the gas mileage averages about 24 mpg which isn't the best in terms of a sedan.  But 3.5L V6 baby!,

1996,21-12-2006,4,0,4.25," I purchased the car about a year ago from a dealer. The car had 100k miles on it I have driven it 13k miles. My previous car was a Porsche 924 I liked the sporty handling of the 924. I wanted a larger car I am 6'3"" tall not many cars are comfortable for a tall person. I test drove a 94 Toyota Camry it was a quality car but boring to drive. My Maxima SE handling performance reminded me somewhat of the Porsche. The four wheel disk brakes saved the day when I noticed a car stalled right in front of me on the freeway. I the brakes stopped straight and true when I slammed on the brakes. (I have ABS) The Max more power than I expected. I have just done basic maintenance on the car.",
1996,30-08-2004,3,0.6908,4.5,The amount of interior room. The comfort. Wonderful handling and brakes. Getting over 30 mpg on the freeway in 5th gear. Overall reliability. I have also owned Nissan pickups. Nissan seems as good as Honda or Toyota but seem to sell for less money. ,
1996,24-01-2011,1,0.631,5,The car side mirrors have considerable blind spots. That is my only concern about the car. Perhaps someone who is not as tall as me may not have this problem. I wish the car was a foot longer it needs more trunk space. ,

1996,19-05-2010,2,0,4.875, Bought my first maxima in 2005 and it ended up being the best car I ever owned in my life. It drove like a dream and never gave me more than a ounce of trouble. It had about 125k on it when it was stolen. It still drove better than a lot of new cars. The police recovered it and I wanted badly to regain ownership and start driving her again. But the stupid police stored it outside with the sunroof wide open and it rained for two days straight ruining the interior and making the car a total loss. I bought a few other cars including a 2000 maxima but none drove as good as my 96 maxie. So finally a year later I'm planning on getting my second maxie this one a 98. ,

2015,11-09-2015,3,-0.4019,4, One of the big reasons we bought a Rogue Select was price it was $3000 dollars less than any of it's competitors around here.  Before we went shopping the Mrs. demanded that whatever we buy have a backup camera so we ended up forking over the extra $800 for the Convenience Package which included the backup camera steering wheel controls (including cruise control which isn't included in the base price) Bluetooth and a few other things. If we hadn't opted for that this might be a different review. I'll explain why.,
2015,24-07-2016,3,-0.2263,3,Ride and Drive: No complaints here the Rogue has peppy acceleration and smooth handling. It gets a little loud if you stomp it but overall performance is surprisingly good and it absorbs bumps well without losing road feel.,
2015,27-05-2016,2,0.8633,5,Interior: The overall impression is about what you'd expect from an entry-level crossover with a few really good things. The seats are extremely comfortable on long trips and they support well for feeling so soft. The steering wheel controls (convenience package) are very easy to get used to an hour behind the wheel will have you changing stations (or Ipod) answering your phone hands-free and manipulating the cruise control without taking your hands off the wheel or your eyes off the road. ,
2015,29-06-2016,2,0.9284,4,A big problem with the Rogue's overall styling is that there are HUGE blind spots in the rear the backup camera helps a lot when backing in somewhere but the driver has to be careful changing lanes in traffic.,
2015,15-06-2015,2,0.2655,2.625,Rear seat room is decent two adults can ride comfortably three may be a tight fit depending on size. The rear seats don't move back and forth. Cargo room is pretty good considering the outside of the Rogue is smaller than most crossovers.,
2017,04-01-2017,1,0.886,5," For starters keep in mind that I'm 44 years old and have owned multiple trucks from multiple manufacturers I'm not a ""must buy this or that brand guy."" The truck is too new to measure reliability yet but Nissan gives you piece of mind with its standard bumper to bumper 5 year 100k warranty. What I love most about this truck is that nothing stands out what do I mean by that? SV with convenience package has everything I need. The seats are ridiculously comfortable the power is more than expected the curb appeal is 2nd to none the standard features do what they're supposed to with no awkward controls. Everything just blends operates and does what I expect it to and this truck is second none. Props to Nissan for a job well done!",
2017,20-02-2017,1,0.8122,1, 2/24/ 17 we purchased a 2017 nissan titan SV what we believed to be a tough work truck with extras. Well within one week we started having issues with the parking sensors and sonar warning light staying on. off the dealership with this truck for repair. a day later they state it was repaired and ready to pick up. on the way home the sonar warning came on and the parking sensor error back on. back to the dealership again this time they said it needed a right frony sensor it came in a few days later so the truck was left there for repairs we received a phone call the truck was ready to pick up. we get to the dealership and upon going out to the truck and starting it the same issues appeared the sonar warning and parking sensor errors again went right back in the dealership and again the truck was left at the dealership then service calls us and tells us the truck needs to have the sonar module replaced. so we wait and a couple days later we receive a phone call that the truck is all done and ready to pick up so back to the dealership only to arrive at the dealership to find out that they have the truck back in the shop again for the same issues/problems and we are being told by the service advisor that once again the truck needs more parts replaced with this tome being a pin for a wire harness/connector. what a blow to us. especially when since the first time this vehicle was taken in the service advisor stated that he checked all connectors and all appeared to be in great shape. so now the truck is still at the dealership waiting parts and repair. We contacted Nissan usa consumer affairs division to file for a lemon and a replacement truck this is pending and takes weeks. the dealership will only do a trade towards another truck which cost us several thousand dollar loss on the trade NO WAY!  apparently this dealership service has been in contact with Nissan tech dept. and being told try this and that which so far nothing has worked to fix the issues.   Now we are very skeptical of these trucks especially since this is a new truck with very little miles on it. what next?,
2017,01-12-2016,4,-0.7366,3, I was excited to purchase the new 2017 model with great expectations.  After 2 weeks of driving and evaluations Nissan did an exceptional job of adding many more features.  7 speed transmission was a big hit.  With the older Titan 5 speed it shifted on hills with high rev.  Power was better pulling the RV.  So many new features that was needed was a big plus.  The biggest drawback is the handling.  The steering wheel was very stiff and due to the added size of the truck it took much more space to turn and handle.  In all I loved the feel of the smaller older Titan but like the more luxurious and more power of the new Titan.  If I was in the market for new Titan I would really take the time to get the feel of the steering and the new larger size to see if it is worth the upgrade.  I would have preferred little larger than the older Titan with all the new features.  Hope they improve on the size and handling in the future...,
2017,22-03-2017,1,0.9636,4, I had the older version Titan so I tried for the newer version Titan. 6 months in these are my opinions. At first I thought exterior looks were hands down Old Titan but after driving it I give the new bold big look a tick under the Old Titan. Interior wise hands down goes to the New Titan. Spacious lots of storage comfortable all the way around materials are great layout is great just flows with you. Electronic wise the New Titan is upgraded but still has some of the bluetooth glitches occasionally and USB work great if you have an iPod or iPhone. But still has the Rockford Fosgate system that is way better than the Old Titan. I did have to replace front sonar sensor only after 2 months of owning. So I call it a draw. Power wise the new V8 dusts the old V8 and I thought that was a strong motor. The 7 speed tranny takes a little getting use to. Towing is off the chain and 4WD is a beast. Reality hurts when it comes to MPG but my Old titan wasn't much better. I drive a mixed run of city and hwy and typically every tank of gas is 16.5 to 17.2 depending on if I drive more than the other. I have taken it on multiple road trips and it is by far a better ride and power than the Old Titan. My only serious grip is that the New Titan does not turn sharp and is awkward in tight spaces where as my Old Titan never had these issues. Overall I recommend it over Tundra Ram for sure. Just a simple test drive puts it over these two easy. I have driven a 2017 F150 and Silverado 4WD in my opinion Titan is very comparable to the F150 maybe a tick above in some cases but a tick below in others but both of these fall a little short of the Silverado which right now is top gun in this class. My deal came to financing in which Nissan had the upper hand. It really is an opinion based drive them go from there. The New Titan has definetly come along way.,

2012,23-01-2013,1,0,4.125, I was considering a TSX TL  Passat V6 and maxima and walked out of the door with $30k for an SV. I thought it was a good deal. I guess not. The car that stickered for $37k is now worth $24k miles with 10k miles on the clock. Its a good car if you want to commute and keep for a while as the car is very reliable interior materials are above average. CVT is not really responsive until in Ds mode. Seats are good for long drives and offer plenty of room. you get a lot of standard features for $30k . Considering base 3 series and A4 are smaller and slower. Steering feel is very good and precise. spend a little more and get a base TL  better in every way . ,

2004,30-11-2012,4,0.4588,3, I purchased a 2004 Nissan Maxima after extensive research as a left over in January 2005. The car was garaged 95% of the time and serviced by the dealership until the warranty expired. ,
2004,13-01-2015,1,0,1,Traveling from South Carolina to Pennsylvania the ABS and Brake lights illuminated. Standard brakes were still operational subsequently I drove the car to the Faulkner dealership in Harrisburg. Here the mechanics determined there was a fault code indicating an entire ABS replacement. They also found rust on the floorboards under the front wheel wells. Add this to a sunroof motor failure just days prior to the ABS brakes failing.,
2004,18-02-2014,1,-0.7096,2.75,Stranded in Harrisburg I did a little research and quickly identified a TSB on Maxima brakes. Nissan owners posted on this subject frequently as well as rust under the floorboards and sunroof failure. I shared my findings with the dealership when they called to announce the nearly 5K in repairs needed for the Maxima.,
2004,25-05-2016,2,0.0516,4,The Faulkner dealership then directed me to call the Nissan Corporate Customer Assistance. I explained the situation and that the car was indeed 8 years old but had merely 60K miles most of which were highway. The interview process was consistent from the dealership to the customer service representative to the final mediator. I realized I was repeating information on the car for three days. The global narrative included;,
2012,29-03-2013,1,0,2.5, Brand new car and there is condensation in both side mirror lights. Nissan claims this is normal. This car is beautiful to look. The car is very roomy and is easy to drive in the city (just watch out for the wide turns). On the highway the handling is terrible and a lot of wind noise. I get frustrated when i have to sync my ipod because it doesnt work the 1st 2nd or even 3rd time. If you are interested in an Maxima Please Go check out the Acura TSX/TL Honda Accord Lexus ES Toyota Camry/Avalon. ,

2012,03-07-2015,3,0.0258,5, I took a long look at Avalon Acura TL and Buick before buying a Nissan Maxima.,
2012,19-07-2013,3,0,4.625,I was influenced by the sportiness of the car based on son's inputs in comparisons to all 3 other choices.,
1993,17-08-2007,3,0,4.75, This is one of the best cars I have ever owned. I have been driving it for almost 14 years and it never gave me any big problem. It is amazing.

2007,20-02-2013,1,0,2.125,I went to dealership on Jan/Feb 13 & till then I did not have any problem. I went again on 07/13 just after my warranty expired & now dealer says I have following issues and the price for it. Nissan Dealership is not telling me issues with cars until warranty runs out so that they can get money out of me. I have 5 year around 3 month and 49900 mileage on my 2007 Nissan murano SL.,
2016,02-06-2016,2,0.3089,4, We needed a SUV to tow a boat and a 3rd row seat for our family. The Pathfinder provided all of these things.  We got a great deal on a 2015 with Platinum trim.  After a month of driving we are still enjoying all the features. I realy like the back up camera and 360 degree view it offers. Towing has been fine.,
2016,19-11-2016,4,0.8957,5, Had the 2016 Nissan Platinum and traded for a Mini Van...I don't know what I was thinking. And I'll be back Nissan..don't change anything!!!! I can't even express how much I loved the 360 cam Bose heated second seats and a/c front seats controls on the steering wheel for everything!!! I could go on with so many more features!!! Movable second row with car seats in!! Never was a Nissan fan but owned it and now miss it!!! It has even more stuff and comfort..dare I say it...then the MDX. Listen go test drive this first and then test drive your other options and you'll go back to this! We have owned Acura Honda GMC Subaru Infiniti Jeep you name it we have owned it and other then the Subaru having minimal space...I would actually return to this vehicle in a second! Pathfinder was a great vehicle in 2000/2002 but it got cheap in the later 2009/2010 and now it's back it's roots. Nice job Niss I'll be back!,
2016,22-11-2016,4,0.9289,2," the first thing that you have to know is that the bluetooth technology that is in the car is the worst! unless you want to spend an extra 10000 dollars to get the fully loaded version but then that would put you on high priced vehicle and with that might price you might be able to get some thing with more luxury. The bluetooth capabilities are just to hear a phone call come in....that is it! You may ask.....what about audio streaming? NOPE not available. you would have to buy a dongle/adapter for it or some audio cables that are going to be hanging out of your middle console and look crappy. (yes im picky like that) i just feel that it is not worth the price. my 200000 nissan rougue had audio streaming; i paid twice as much for this one. I do not get navigation so i have 6 BUTTONS from my stearing wheel to the control panel that do the same thing!....... and that is to change my radio station one up......really? I know that my review is mostly on the sound system ...and it is but i like to go down to the details like these. When i purchased the car i asked if bluetooth was included and they said yes but i never thought that it would be just for calls. when i told my dealer about the complaint the sales guy said ""yeah sometimes the cheaper cars have better feautures""....(wow) Also nissan stated that they spent 6000 just on the entertaining system; mmmm i don't know you would think that 6000 dollars can get you a higher quality screen for your dash board. there are also two ""back"" buttons 2 ""settings"" buttons 2 ""info"" buttons that alone is just 6 buttons wasted. i hope that this review makes sense to you i do think that the car is a good reliable car but after driving it for several months i feel like it is not worth the money that i am paying on it.",
2016,21-05-2017,2,0.9359,2, If you don't care about fuel economy and power then this will be the best suv for you. Bluetooth pairing is very bad i like ford sync better. Max MPG i may get is when i put the car in 2WD mode. NISSAN says that AUTO mode does change the drive mode to 2WD for higher MPG but this is not true. I hope nissan gets away from CVT transmission some day. The latest i heard is nissan dealers are trying to get ride of this vehicle from their lots by reducing the prices  eg a sales rep went from 40K to 32K in less than 5 min for a platinum 4WD. So I would ask buyers to spend extra money on MDX or MAZDA CX9,
2016,19-02-2016,1,-0.5965,5, After reading so many disparaging reviews I left the Nissan Pathfinder for my last test drive.  Earlier the same day I drove the top rated Kia Sorento and the Honda Pilot.  I can say that they are all nice in their own way and all noisy when the engine is pushed.,

2016,16-12-2016,4,0.5837,1, I got this as a rental car I was excited to see it only had 10 miles on it so I was the first driver.  As the miles of my trip went by my excitement turned to despair.  This is a truly crummy car worse than my 15 year old Hyundai Elantra.  The road noise is deafening the acceleration is feeble the radio was already broken and the plastic-ness of the interior was profound.,
2016,13-04-2016,2,-0.5267,2, I've been renting this car for three weeks. Horrible design. No storage no pick up engine sluggish. Nice controls seats are comfortable. I would not buy this car. Can't wait to get my Camry back.,
2016,23-05-2016,2,-0.5423,5, overall it a great starter car for credit repair its light on the road especially on windy days so i added 120lbs in my trunk which gave it stability other than that i love my 2016 Versa Sedan........ but my next car will be a NIssan Sentra only because im moving up lol or maybe i will stay with the Versa......,
2016,09-06-2017,2,0.8641,5, Remember you are buying a Versa not a Highend  vehicle. Love this little car though. Bought it for me as a retirement runaround car and my my wife liked it so much she wants the highend Hatchback model.,
2009,07-12-2010,4,-0.1451,4.125, I traded in a GMC Envoy because the gas mileage was killing me and I did not really need that big of a car. The interior although well made is plain and simple. The car performs well but I would not call it fun. It is reliable in every respect but there is nothing to get excited about. But after 18 months it has grown on me as being a very good all around good practical safe comfortable and reliable transportation. ,

Went everywhere and without complaint. took the best care of my baby. could fit both of my tall sons in the back with room. When i finally blew a head gasket last week I considered getting something else but my car guy said that he had the same make and model just 2 years newer and for under $2000.00 he would take my old and give me new.....I took it. My son wanted me to get a volvo that he had on the lot but I saw the 98 and it was not even an option. I had to have the nissan. Now I have my baby 2.0.

2003,26-04-2010,2,0.8484,4.75, I bought my Nissan Sentra in 2003 right off the lot. I wanted something dependable. I had my first issue with the car at 85000 miles. I had to replace a belt $30. At 93000 miles I replaced a battery $75. At 115000 miles I replaced a sensor $160. An now at 125000 miles I have another $50 issue. So in 7 years I have only put $315 worth of parts in it(minus tune ups oil changes & tires). I can't complain AT All! Daily Driver and now is managing to be my childrens car to learn to drive it.

2001,10-05-2005,2,0,2.125," I bought this truck used from an individual in 12/05 and have since put about 12000 miles on it.  Overall I love this little truck for what it is: an inexpensive efficient little hauler.  It's not very powerful or roomy on the inside but for a ""compact"" truck (of which there really aren't any more these days) it excels in many other areas.   I routinely average 26 mpg on the highway (as high as 30mpg on a couple of trips) and about 22 mpg in mixed/city driving -- this is fantastic I think given that this is a TRUCK and not at all designed for efficiency.   I've had a few mechanical issues to deal with (front suspension bushings worn rear shocks worn) but nothing major to date.",
2001,07-11-2004,4,0.8866,3.125,The great gas mileage is one of my favorite things about this truck.  Also I'm impressed by the number of storage places in the cab -- there are 5 (!) cupholders a deep console and various other storage areas scattered throughout.

1998,30-05-2006,2,0,2.5," I bought my Nissan Frontier brand new on the advice of a Toyota dealer friend of mine.  He said ""Toyota trucks are great but so are the Nissans and they're cheaper.""  After 8 years and 124000 miles with my Frontier I couldn't agree with him more.  My truck has been great:  no major repairs no recalls no production defects.  Just change the oil every 6000 miles and enjoy trouble-free performance.  Very comfortable driving position.  The 4 cyl. motor is a little underpowered but the gas mileage is great (21.5 to 28.5 mpg).  My only complaint is that the headlights burn out every 18 to 24 months but you can easily replace the bulbs yourself at a cost of about $13.",

I do enjoy driving it - it is fun!  I know you can get a newer truck with better mileage and more modern features but - I like the body style and I do not see too many SCs around.

It has been comfortable all the way. I have traveled with three adults on trips of more than 200 miles with no complaints from the back seat passengers. I even used it to remove the remnants of a tree that I was unable to dig out. It is high enough to see over traffic but not uncomfortable when entering numbers on a keypad to a parking lot.

I have been waiting for over 2 months to get my truck back because their ""parts people"" from Chicago had originally gotten the wrong parts number for the tranny and are now waiting for a solenoid so they can complete the rebuild... I am now in the position that (if I ever get the truck back) I have more in it than it's worth so I HAVE to drive it now...",
2006,29-10-2006,4,0.4588,4.75,The body style is very cool looking. I arctic white is a great color. The bed hooks can be moved to accommodate for most things I'm hauling. The truck has incredible power/towing capacity for it's size. Although many knock it for it's bland/plastic interior design I think it's rather sleek and pretty comfortable. The gas mileage is very good too. It's really too bad I had to endure this terrible transmission problem... I was considering another Nissan product for my wife to drive but now I won't even give it a second thought.,
2008,30-04-2008,2,0.6113,4.75, I have wanted a truck for the last 10 yrs so I finally bought it. It was either the Tacoma or the Frontier that I narrowed it to.  The exterior of the truck is gorgeous. The interior has a lot of hard plastics but are assembled nicely.  I am amazed how smooth the powertrain is in this truck. It provides plenty of power for passing on the freeway. The optional stereo sounds very nice. The audio controls on the steering wheel are handy as is the bluetooth. Seat comfort is very good in the front seats and acceptable in the rear. Fuel economy is about 16- 17 mixed and 20-22 on the freeway so far. Purchased for invoice plus $3000 in rebates. Nissan was a better value than the Toyota overall.,

2008,08-04-2008,2,0,4.75, This is my 2nd Nissan Frontier since their redesign in 2005 just turned my 3 yr lease and now I have the Red Pearl 2008 as loaded as it can come. It's a great midsize truck good for work or play. I used it for both work family and a little beach riding. I regularly max the 4.0 out highway driving daily in PA. It will max out right about 115 electronically limited at 4500 RPM  top gear which is acceptable given that you're still going way too fast anyway.,

2002,27-10-2006,4,0.7096,2.875, A bit underpowered.  Poor fuel economy (15-17 mpg in combined city/highway use.  Fairly comfortable with good room front & back although back less so for adults.  The long bed is handy although it makes thre truck very difficult to park; a short bed with the removable bed extender might be good enough if you don't haul large items regularly.  One extremely annoying design flaw: the vents cannot be closed completely off and the ductwork runs close to the engine so hot air is blown in all the time.  On days over about 65 degrees you have to keep the a/c turned on or windows down or it gets very warm inside.,
2002,06-04-2005,2,0.3415,4.75,Redesign the vent system please!,
2002,26-07-2006,3,0.3802,3.625, The truck drives great the only issue is the gas mileage but that is only becuase I was used to driving a 4 cylinder and this is a V6.  Handles wonderful in snow and rain.  Looks nice and I love that we bought it.,

2002,07-05-2016,2,0,5, I saved literally thousands of dollars by buying a code reader and simply erasing the bogus cat failure codes. I do almost all of the maintenance. including the timing belt; the truck has seen the inside of a shop only twice for small repairs.  Some features of the design are stupid.  Replacing the driver's side valve cover gasket is a total nightmare because the intake plenum has to be removed.  You also have to take off the plenum to replace the knock sensor although it can be relocated to the top of the engine. I figure that these are dealer-welfare designs. ,
2002,25-07-2007,3,-0.4767,4.75,Altogether I have been happy with this my first truck.  It is the perfect size for my hauling and commuting needs.  I hear tI needed another truck. hat the new ones don't have the bugs of the '02s.  Probably would buy one if,

2009,20-08-2010,3,0,5, AWESOME !  This is without a doubt the best truck for the buck I've owned since I bought my first Toyota in 1982.  What those trucks did for Toyota this truck should do for Nissan. I read that the output of this 6-cyl was near the F-150 and I had towed with the F-150 (22 ft Boston Whaler Dauntless) so I bought it. It pulls her out of the ramp in the snow and ice we get here in Montana 4-wheels the mountains and gets over 20 MPG if I don't go over 70 MPH.  It does a whole lot better on premium and lousy if you put in alcohol contaminated gasoline.  I know that because I took this truck across country towing a smaller boat. Geared right for whatever you want a truck to do.,
2009,28-04-2010,2,0.5525,5,I thought the hill button was a joke when I bought the rig...now I use it all the time. Like the heated seats tie downs in bed the way the back seats fold up  hell I love everything about this truck except that it can't fly,
2009,23-04-2010,2,0.5106,4.75,Shift-able automatic.  I wish NISSAN made this truck in a turbo diesel with enough power to pull and good road economy .... or make a diesel for the Titan and blow everyone else out of the pond!,

2009,14-06-2016,2,0,2, I will start this review off stating that the North Carolina Consumer Council urges people to stay away from this vehicle: http://www.carcomplaints.com/news/2016/dont-buy-nissan-pathfinder-frontier-xterra.shtml,
2009,19-01-2016,1,0,4,If you're looking to purchase a used Frontier it is imperative to look out for two costly failures. They start occurring around the 100k mark. I will list them from most to least expensive.,
2009,17-04-2010,2,-0.5267,4.875,1. Coolant leaks in the transmission fluid. Bring a ratchet with an extension and a 10mm socket to remove the bolt and check the transmission fluid. The dipstick isn't easy to find so Google it and you'll see where to locate it. If the transmission fluid is pink or has the look and consistency of Pepto Bismol the transmission will fail and the radiator will need to be replaced. Estimated cost to repair at Nissan dealership = $3500 - $6000,
2009,04-12-2009,4,-0.7101,4.75,2. Listen for the timing chain tensioner failure.  After starting the engine pop open the hood and listen to area where the timing chain is near also if you can have someone rev it up a few times to see if you hear the whine; if you hear a whining sound similar to an remote controlled car moving then timing chain tensioner has failed and the timing belt will eventually get too loose and destroy the engine. All of the timing chains and tensioners will need to be replaced. Estimated cost to repair at Nissan dealership = $1700 - $2000 if ignored and the timing chain fails you will need a rebuilt engine estimated cost ??? (thousands),
2009,06-08-2009,3,-0.9789,4.75,The radiator/transmission issues can be avoided by rerouting the lines that run from the radiator to the transmission directly into the transmission cooler but a better solution is to install an external transmission cooler bypassing the radiator altogether; this way coolant will never have a chance to enter the transmission even if the radiator fails or leaks occur.,
2009,29-07-2009,3,0.0747,3.875, This is my second Nissan Frontier I've owned and drove my 2001 for 8 years and I must say it has been the most reliable vehicle I have ever owned I still own it.  I've owned the new Frontier for 2 months now and the only complaints I have thus far is the drivers seat and the center console.  ,
2009,05-08-2014,3,-0.4019,2.875,Roomiest for a Midsize.  Body style.  Reliability speaking from my 2001 Nissan.,
2009,22-07-2009,3,0,2.875,XE Model they should add Lumbar support for seats.  XE model they kind of scipmted on the rims I've would have paid more for some better rims. The center console needs to be longer.,
2009,23-04-2010,2,0.7063,3, Buyer beware Nissan is using poor quality parts expect expensive repairs at 40000 miles sound familiar putting cheap parts in cars how did that work out for GM. ,
2009,24-07-2016,3,-0.4767,5,Do not waste your hard earned money on poor quality.,
2011,14-08-2013,3,-0.121,4.625, I bought a new 2006 Toyota Tacoma V6 Prerunner and never really liked it. It was way too sensitive to any wind. It took a tight grip on the steering wheel to keep it on the road on a windy day. If it had been windy the day I test drove it I would never had bought it. The Frontier drives great on windy days and very little wind noise compared to the Tacoma. It rides better gets better fuel mileage better transmission and has more power. The only gripe is the interior scratches easily and the turning radius is not as tight as the Tacoma. I went from a truck I hated to a truck I love to drive. That says it all.,
2011,02-03-2011,1,0.9127,5,Styling size ride and power.,
2011,16-10-2011,4,0,5,Upgrade interior move the console armrest toward the front and improve the turning radius.,
2011,01-07-2011,3,0.4404,3.625, Nissan should have named the 4x4 the Mountain Goat series..the Frontier out performs every other truck in it's class. Built like it looks. ,

2011,20-03-2012,1,0.7574,4.875,The passenger fold down seat rattles and drives me crazy.,
2011,02-10-2011,4,-0.34,4.625, Overall I am mostly satisfied with this truck. I've driven this one for just over 8000 miles.,
2011,08-07-2015,3,0.4215,5,"I like the exterior styling except for the excessive amounts of ""chrome"" or bright shiny metal/plastic. I'm fine with the bumpers being shiny but the front bumper along with the bright grille is simply to much in my opinion. Not a big deal I'm paint the grille and that problem is solved.They also attempted to solve this in the 2012 model with the sports package.",
2011,19-03-2013,1,0.6808,5,I'm nearly satisfied with the interior. The materials could have been a bit better but aren't bad overall. It just seems as if the plastics scuff up pretty easily.,
2011,09-12-2010,4,0.9328,5,Lastly the automatic transmission is a bit of a gear hunter.,
2011,09-09-2011,3,0,4.875,Ground clearance power MPG (personal best of 22.6 avg of 19.6) general quality inside and out. Ample room everywhere locking glovebox and dual glove box.,

2010,29-03-2010,1,0.8999,4.125, Recently bought truck.  Has value package & bed liner with bed extender.  Considered Tacoma Dakota Ranger & Colorado.  1st truck since 89 Toyo 4x4 with 4 cyl manual.  Main reason for buying Frontier over Tacoma (1st choice) - $.  Nissan gave $2K rebate plus another $1K since I own Toyota + dealer sold well below invoice.  Great value for $.  Was torn between the 4 cyl and 6.  Got the 4 because it's mostly a commuter truck with weekend warrior activity.  After 1700 miles happy with truck but 4 cyl lacks power with auto trans.  Highway driving is fine when up to speed.  But lack of power is apparent when getting on highway stoplight to stoplight hills or with load in bed.  ,
2010,21-02-2010,1,0.6808,4.875,Looks seat comfort decent gas mileage (averaging 23 mpg highway 20 mpg city after break in).  Added weather tech floor mats and a keyless keypad.  Fog lights next.  Best feature - price price price.  Extended cab 16 wheels auto power package bed liner bed extender etc. for way below Tacoma,
2010,29-11-2009,4,0.7717,5,Only 2 Engine options.  Overkill with the 6 cyl and marginal with the 4. The 4 just barely cuts it.  Manual would be better but hard to find on the SE.  Overall my needs are being met.  Cheap transport to and from work light duty weekend chores mountain bikes kayak etc.  ,
2010,14-06-2016,2,-0.0267,1," Bought this truck just before Christmas 2009. I tell you what a fun truck to drive  a very very peppy 4cyl with a smooth shifting Auto Trans. This truck really moves handles well and is very very quiet! Had a 2000 Frontier but this one is a far cry better !!! I would recommend the 4cyl Auto to anyone if you just need a truck to drive and not pulling anything. Plenty of ZIP getting on the Highway. Love the ride also the 16"" tires and wheels are a nice addition. Overall as you can tell i am very impressed with this truck the more i drive it the more i like it !!! And it is a very nice looking truck at that ! Traded a Honda CRV for this and have not looked back since !!!   Way to go NISSAN",
2010,15-06-2010,2,0.9841,2.875,"Very quiet interior plenty of room Love the 4 door set upwith the 16"" wheels it sits up high and gives a safe feeling that you can see very well all around you. The seats are very comfy i might add i do not feel cramped in this truck. Overall very Impressed thanks Nissan ! Like the 3yr 36 warr",
2010,31-07-2017,3,0.9604,5, Get the Crew Cab!,
2010,09-03-2011,1,0,4.125, Bought an SE King Cab and have liked it with the manual and V-6: great acceleration and fun to drive.,
2010,30-07-2010,3,0.8807,4.875,My issue is that despite having paid for Nissan spare tire lock the spare was stolen within weeks and Nissan is refusing to do anything. The ease of stealing spare tires is big issue for Nissan trucks & SUVs (I had two stolen off 2008 Pathfinder) and it's very hard to find a way to secure them. Almost every Nissan SUV owner in my neighborhood that I've spoken with has same issue. Dealer said Nissan lock would suffice but the thieves just bypassed it and removed everything from above the spare - and yes they also stole the lock!!,
2010,26-04-2010,2,-0.777,4.75,Will cost me $1000 to replace it all.,
2010,03-04-2010,2,0,4.375,Very unhappy...,
2011,03-01-2014,1,0,4, I bought this car to get me something with good gas mileage that was different with all wheel drive and standard bluetooth. And a sub compact size with a good fun-to-drive ratio. And it had to have a sticker of under 22k,
2011,09-06-2013,2,0.7003,4,Overall its an okay vehicle but I've been talking to people (nissan techs - to remain nameless) who've all said to trade it in after the warranty is up. That is enough for me to say I won't own another one again but overall its not terrible. The major complaints are three:,
2011,13-10-2010,4,0.0595,4.25,1. MPG is not what was promised,
2011,11-01-2012,1,-0.2755,4.875,2. Gas tank is only about 11 gallons,
2011,01-02-2016,1,0,3,3. Although you don't have to run 93 octane your really should to,
2011,14-04-2011,2,0,4.75, Love at first test drive love the quick throttle repsonse never drove a car that was actually fun to drive ! this makes me excited for my daily 52 mile round trip to work. I sold my 06 Mazda 3i to get this Juke SV & it was the best sale I have ever made ! very smooth ride quiet & the MPG is awesome ! similar size gas tank compared to my Mazda 3 & I seem to be using less gas in the Juke so I have to wonder all you reviews that said it gets horrible MPG do you never take it off the sport mode & drive like a maniac ? I love how the bullfrog body is like no other manufacturers out there & it fits all my needs as a 4-dr since I plan on having kids somedays. motorcycle-like interior is cool!,
2011,17-10-2013,4,0.9804,3,Turbo engine blue tooth & the fact that it reads you who is calling before you answer! 4 doors push start button- which was made for us females who are sick of digging thru our purses each time for keys no more w/ this car as long as it's in your purse or pocket you are good to go miles available until nxt fill tire pressure reading if low quite sound when locking w/ the button on the drivers handle sterring wheel buttons- cant live w/out them once you get used to them & I like how they made the buttons change when u press either climate or drive mode smart way to stash lots of buttons. & love the fact that now i only have to tint 2 windows instead of 5 ! I love the very dark tint!,
2011,14-01-2015,1,0.8617,1,"A middle console/ arm rest would be nice soley to have more personal hidden storage all you get is the glove box which by the way I still havent figured out how to lock w/ the valet key that's inside the intelligent key.... if anyone has please email me & make me feel stupid :) Just a few more inches for the rear passengers would have been good but at 5'5 med build I fit well with the front seat all the way back. The drivers seat is not made for ""larger"" ppl as I weight 170 & have womanly hips & any bigger & the seatbelt would bother my hips being so close to it every day in such a small seat. rear hatchback cover would also have been nice for privacy of items when shopping :) ",
2011,20-08-2011,3,0.9413,4.875, Great driving vehicle. Enjoyed our time together. That is until it died without any warning. Guess what - it was the timing chain. No warning and no sign of any problem. It broke and left me in the middle of the highway. I was able to coast to the next exit and wait for a tow to the nearest Nissan dealer. I had no idea what the problem was. I thought it was electrical. They confirmed it was not electrical and it was the engine. But it would take 5 hours to take it apart to diagnose the problem. That means I would have to pay them $500 to tell me the engine was dead and needed to be replaced. The timing chain appears to be very common. Nissan was not helpful. It was just outside the warranty.,
2011,26-07-2011,3,-0.9399,2.25,Nissan needs to be asamed of themselves. They are selling a defective vehicle with serious design flaws. What will it take for them to man up and fix the problem?  They need to stand behind this and fix the defective parts.  They need to repay the poor soles who are forced to replace the engine.,
2014,26-02-2017,1,-0.9313,5," Bought this car for my wife and she absolutely loves it!  ""It fits me"" is what she says.  Comfort durability and mileage are all great.",
2014,29-12-2016,4,0.7773,1," They suck you in to buy it because of the look and color options but in reality it is the most unsafe unreliable money pit vehicle I've ever owned!  The entire vehicle is like a cheap combination of plastic and thin thin metal.  I had to replace the tires before I even had 15000 miles on it just so I could pass state inspection.  The windows are so cheap that when I got a very small rock chip I parked it in the garage so that the next day my insurance could fill it so it didn't spider but the next day when I opened the garage I was shocked at how it had completely spidered over the entire windshield and it was only 30 degrees outside and my ""Joke"" was parked in the garage so needless to say I had to get a new windshield!  The gas mileage is so bad I can fill up and never even get more than 260 miles on a tank of gas.  The list goes on by a lot but I'm just trying to warn others not to get sucked into buying this vehicle because of the color options!!  Just beware!",
2014,26-08-2014,3,-0.8144,5," I nicknamed it ""The Ugly Duckling"" because my first instinct was to NOT buy it.",
2014,06-10-2015,4,-0.5106,3,However my husband and son fell in love with it and I agreed because it's a Nissan (this is our 5th Nissan) and a manual (I hate automatic cars).,

2014,18-03-2016,1,-0.3595,4,I've been driving for more than 40 years and this car is the BEST I've ever driven.,
2011,06-05-2014,2,0.7125,4, bought mine new in 4/2011 and truth is i thank god haven't had any problems. I'm sorry to hear about the people who are having problems with the chain. i just got called last week from the dealer to take it in to have the chain replace which after reading the reviews i will do ASAP. i do however hate that it goes thru gas like crazy i'm looking into buying a more gas efficient car but to be honest there is nothing out there that i like or that would make me trade my Bionic frog.,
2011,25-03-2012,1,0.9099,5, ,
2011,17-09-2011,3,0,4.125,Love the CVT transmission don't feel the jolt love the way it handles on the frwy (when i'm able to actually go frwy speeds i live in L.A so i'm always in traffic) it's a pretty fast car and the pickup is great especially if i'm driving it in manual mode. I love that the car sits up high like an SUV from which i can get in & out without any problem. ,
2011,02-04-2016,2,0.9768,5,i don't know about the newer models but the 2011 the interior (room) is terrible the only comfortable person in the car is the driver i can't fit anyone in the back sit there is no room there is no arm room (when driving rest your arm on) no storage compared to the Versa (2008 which is what i had before) and of course don't forget it's not a good gas efficient car it's like i'm driving a V8 well i guess power requires gas. and still can't find anything i like out there. ,

2013,01-02-2016,1,-0.1685,4, I live in suburb of Wash D.C.  Work in downtown D.C. shop in suburban shopping centers. Due to size of car maneuverability visibility I regularly can fit into parking spaces other cars can't(on D.C. streets) and can get in and out of spaces and lanes in suburban lots while others with larger vehicles are backing up and moving forward over & over to get out of space blocking entire lane entire time. Have likely saved hundreds of dollars in parking lot fees in downtown DC. because find parking at the curb for far less(or nothing at all),
2013,08-04-2013,2,0.4215,4.875, I've had my 2012 Juke for 16 months and have 26000 miles already!,
2013,04-07-2013,3,0,5,It's cute sexy and out performs anything I've owned to date.,
2013,06-09-2016,3,0.7506,5,Traded in a 2000 Wrangler and was really afraid I'd be disappointed... NO WAY!!,
2013,02-07-2017,3,-0.5449,5,I love it!,
2013,16-07-2016,3,0.6696,5," Have had my NISMO for about 3 years and Absolutely NO problems with this car.  I love it.  Gets great gas mileage!  The ONLY thing that could be improved is it is equipped with Summer Sport tires and would be much better with All Season Tires for those who live in snow prone areas; but then a lot of new sport cars are equipped this way.  (When it's time to replace them I'll  get all seasons'.)   I get many compliments on my NISMO because it has tons of sporty ""personality"".... it certainly does NOT look like EVERY other car on the road!!  Everybody wants one!  Mine is a 6 speed manual.  I live up a very steep winding hill.  Driving in in ""Turbo"" is an absolute blast!  Great acceleration and grip.  Lots of cargo space in the back.  Great dealership service.  Check one out!!",
2013,08-07-2013,3,0.9825,4.875, The design got my attention right at the first time. specs are impressive real value for a sporty yet powerful small suv/crossover. i liked it in all ways. great new look great horsepower great gas mileage and low price what else can i bargain.,

2011,21-12-2010,4,0,4.25,I have a 100 mile daily commute and the Xterra was way too expensive to drive.,
2011,21-01-2013,1,0,2,Just happened to find the juke which meets the same needs I had with my Xterra a vehicle to take skiing and load my kayaks on.,
2011,01-11-2011,4,0,4.625,My Juke Box has been great!!,
2011,06-08-2011,3,0.6892,4.875,I'm getting about 29 mph it's a lot more comfortable then my Xterra and with the sport option its great when I need to pass in traffic.,
2012,07-01-2012,1,0.8268,4.625, I love my Juke.,
2012,14-04-2016,2,0.6369,5,Love the exterior styling.,
2012,08-07-2012,3,0.6369,4.25,I receive many comments - mostly favorable.,
2012,27-04-2012,2,0.4767,5,It's the little things that I didn't notice during the test drive that are worth pointing out.,
2012,19-02-2012,1,0.2263,4.875,For this price point you kinda expect to have power locks and auto up windows on both front doors rather than driver only.,
2013,13-05-2014,2,0,5, I have liked the look of the Juke since I first saw it in 2011.,
2013,08-03-2014,1,0.4215,4.5,Have had mine now for almost 2 months.,
2013,07-07-2014,3,0,4,I average 29.2 mpg in economy mode which blows my jeep out the water.,

2012,29-08-2012,3,0.8176,4.25, Have had this car for about two months now.,
2012,29-12-2015,4,0,4,I purchased this auto because it is very easy to steer and also has the AWD feature.,
2012,04-09-2013,3,0.4927,4.75,It is very easy to maneuver & park.,

Lousy gas milage.I do love driving my juke..does good in the snow and icebut you have to dig the snow from the wheel wells daily.and I think I'm getting little rust spots already.and the paint is chipping all over.the car is 2.5 years old.,
2013,26-04-2017,2,0.3031,5, We have only owned the vehicle for a month but so far I like it better than the brand new Ford we purchased. Nissan definitely knows how to build a solid vehicle. Other than rear wheel well road noise it is hands down a much better vehicle than the Escape. I purchased the Juke for my daughters first car. If it works as well as it has been even with high miles on it I will be getting rid of the Ford and purchasing another Juke.,
2010,29-12-2009,4,0.9725,4.125, This is 3rd Nissan Truck and it's an improvement! My first truck that I buy w/ an automatic transmission. Pluses: Mid-size truck feel handsome exterior smooth shifting automatic transmission big cargo bed firmer truck ride lot's of interior storage durable cloth seats power package/keyless entry back doors that swing open to allow the the occasional passengers. Folding side mirrors side airbags anti-lock brakes and bigger fuel tank. Lots more cargo room than my last Frontier! Reputation for reliability and better resale value than most domestic trucks. Today's vehicles have lots of interior plastics and Nissan uses quality plastics. ,
2010,27-10-2011,4,0.9183,4,I like the look and the feel of Midsize truck. Nissan has moved away from the old compact truck and added more aggressive/masculine looks bigger/wider cabin/bed. Great functionality for a truck: Light hauling great daily commuter and more room for passengers. ,
2010,05-12-2014,4,0.8934,3.625,For 2010 model: old/Bland stereo on the SE (4cyn). Installed an after market stereo w/ bluetooth/USB/M3P disk player. Installed a Magnaflow muffler K and N air filter for better performance/fuel economy. Back seats would be more comfortable sideways (according to my passengers). Higher price tag.,
2010,22-12-2011,4,0.7574,4.5, I seriously did not want to like this truck. I,
2010,23-02-2014,1,-0.4646,4,had to purchase a truck for a new business I started. Decided on the Nissan Frontier V6 4x4 because of how well the test ride went against the other midsized trucks like the Tacoma. Solid ridegreat handling for a truck and much quieter interior compared to the noisy Tacoma. I liked the full size Ram but cost and MPG kept me away from it.So I have owned this truck for almost a year now and have to say as much as I want to be pissed about driving a truck daily this well made solid truck is growing on me. Nissan has built a reliable mid sized truck that feels like it can handle real truck work and yet drives rather nicely. 20.2 MPG with a 4x4!,
2008,22-07-2010,3,0.8588,5, I have owned other trucks before but by far my frontier is the best. It is very comfortable to drive on long trips and the gas usage is not bad on the highway.,
2008,27-04-2010,2,0.9474,4.875,I like  everything about the truck,

2008,31-08-2009,3,0.8268,5, Gotta love this truck.  Handles well plenty of power great fuel economy and it's just fun to drive.  I have the 6 speed manual transmission and couldn't be happier,

2008,17-09-2008,3,0,5, After 18 mos still a great truck and I am very happy with it.   No mechanical problems at all.   Service at dealership has been great.  Just got back from a trip into the Colorado Mtns. and it did great on the steep and winding roads. Plenty of power with the 4cylinder.  Got my best gas mileage yet of 27.3 mpg coming down out of the mountains.  So far have averaged 24 mpg in 13000 miles of driving with 90% as highway driving.  No towing.,
2008,12-02-2017,1,0.9468,4,High seating position with good all around vision if you fold down the passenger seat or take off its headrest. I removed the rear jump seat headrests to give better vision outward.,
2008,12-09-2010,3,0.8316,3.25,A/C was working very had at 100 degrees F. to keep the interior cool.  It was marginal at that kind of temperature outside.   otherwise it works well in more moderate temperatures.   I have not tinting on windows so that might improve cooling if I had had that.,
2008,24-01-2012,1,0.7624,4.625, I was all about getting a Toyota Tacoma drove several and liked the raised suspension but the ride itself wasn't that strong.,

2008,29-07-2011,3,0,4.875,Off-the-line pickup in this V6 reminds you of a V8.,
2008,11-05-2009,2,0,4.875,Have yet to tow anything but have used the bed for hauling heavy furniture and haven't noticed a change in the way it drives.,
2008,01-11-2007,4,0,4.625,There seems to be a strong dislike of the interior but in my opinion its a truck and I'm not expecting anything fancy.,
2007,18-10-2010,4,0.09,4.875," When I set out to buy my first news vehicle I knew one thing. I was getting a truck. I researched everything I could about recently produced 4x4 mid-size trucks and was hoping to find and American made that fit my criteria. After all was said and done I bought my '07 frontier brand- new with 205 miles on it. I was spoiled for a few years owning a '78 international scout ii. I have put this Nissan through the same paces that I was able to put old Betsy through however. At 37000 mi. I needed to replace the clutch and now at 78000 I am needing to open the transfer case because the 4x4 won't disengage all of the way. So I ask ""what the hell?"" why are these things breaking?",
2007,23-12-2006,4,0.6868,4.375,The Nissan Frontier SE Crew-Cab is the only truck in it's class that could hold a candle to an International Scout II. I love almost everything about it.  265  hp. 285 ft. lbs. of torque six speed manual transmission four door cruise- control power windows cd player the list goes on.,
2007,11-07-2013,3,0.6369,3.875,Please make this truck a high-output diesel.  Please put in manual- locking hubs and an actual 4x4 shift lever. Please remove the spare tire from under the truck and install a swing-away tail- gate carrier.  Please make the clutch and 4x4 components stronger much stronger.  ,
2007,14-12-2006,4,0.9081,5, Picked over Tacoma for price and overall exterior design. Looks more like a truck.Power is great fuel ok hopefully will get better once broken in.,

2010,15-02-2011,1,0,2.5, Bought my car in May of 2010. Within a month or 3000 miles later car stalled on the way to California from Phoenix. The engine just shut down right in the middle of the freeway really scary as I had my whole family in there. Towed the car to the nearest dealer and they replaced a bad crank sensor. 7000 miles and five months later - same thing. Car stalls tow to dealer - again - bad crank sensor. I have been scared to drive it ever since - just short trips around town. The dealer just shrugged shoulders - just a couple of bad sensor in the row? This is bull. A brand new car and POS has a recurrent catastrophic failure. This is my first and the last Nissan. Should have bought a Toyota...,

2010,11-03-2010,1,0,5, I have owned Nissan trucks in the past and Nissan has really hit a grand slam with this Frontier. The truck has awesome power great torque a solid yet comfortable ride great styling inside and out and decent fuel mileage (If driven conservatively). ,
2010,16-10-2009,4,0.956,4.875,The folding rear seats are so awesome this feature really creates a lot more room for cargo in the rear cabin. I also like how the 4 wheel drive engages with the turn of a knob.,
2002,21-03-2010,1,0.9029,5, This is an update of my original review from 2010. It is now July 2016. I still have this truck I bought new....,
2002,03-01-2011,1,0.3182,4.75,Now I am at 14 years with my Frontier and it still going strong. I bought this truck new in 2002.  I use my Frontier for towing a motorcycle trailer and it does fine.   ,

2002,23-02-2009,1,0.6249,5,The paint is still in good shape even though it is always outdoors in the Florida weather (Including 3 hurricanes in 2004) ,
2002,19-11-2015,4,0.4404,5,In 14 years and 125000 miles I have replaced the A/C compressor a valve cover gasket and a shifter seal. That is it....The gasket and shifter seal...200 bucks including labor....The A/C about 900.... Not bad for 14 years. ,
2007,08-01-2007,1,-0.5423,5, After researching all the medium and small size trucks my choice was the Nissan Frontier. All the nice features style design make it a better choice. The Toyota Tacoma would be my second choice but I paid $2500 less for a Frontier with the same choices. Plus those sales guys at Toyota are really difficult they want you to pay MSRP and don't like to deal. The new Long bed on the Frontier makes it an excellent choice if you compare the size of the bed to the Titan there is not much difference... I love my truck!,

2007,10-01-2007,1,0.4404,5, I love the drive train and suspension on this truck - it drives like a sports car and is a blast to run the 2.5L 4 banger through the gears.  My complaint?  I can't find a comfortable position for the driver's seat. The door panel encroaches on my leg space the front lip of the seat digs into my thighs and the seat bottom/back is just plain hard.  I'm now considering options such as a custom seat upgrade seats from a wrecked SE/LE or possibly reupholstering.   The uncomfortable seats are starting to sour me on an otherwise wonderful truck.  ,

2007,29-11-2006,4,0.4404,5, Driving my mom's tacoma trd after my nismo frontier i noticed this: The frontier is noticeably faster/more powerful. The steering is easier in the tacoma. The frontier had more hip/knee room. Tacoma is quieter. Fronter is sportier. Tacoma sits a tad higher. Frontier has much better price. Tacoma has prettier interior. Frontier has better functionality of interior. Tacoma has nicer wheels. Frontier gets better mileage 19avg vs. 16avg. for tacoma. Tacoma has better bed. Frontier has nicer one piece fenders. Trucks are essentially equal.The difference is Frontier is sportier and for young people.Tacoma is more luxurious and for older people.oh yeah frontier has real chrome bumpers. like em both,
2007,26-11-2006,4,0.9814,4.5,4.0v6 hauls. 6speed manual. sharp minimalistic clean design inside and out. Nice ride height.

2007,05-11-2006,4,0.9485,4.875,Turning radius. Could be quieter more refined interior. heavy tailgate. ,
2007,26-12-2006,4,0,4.875, I bought this truck after comparing with the Tacoma.  The Tacoma is 5 grand more money and the Nissan has the power.  The truck has a real solid feel.  The utility track system in the bed is a great idea and I am looking forward to the first time I have to tie something down.  When the truck is idling you can tell it is a powerhouse.  I haven't owned it that long to encounter any problems.  I haven't had any so far.  Hopefully I won't.  Fuel economy could be better but you can't have it both ways.  I had a Matrix.  32mpg but no power or size.  This truck has some weight to it and is a real powerhouse,

2006,24-10-2006,4,0,4.875, I bought a 2006 Nismo CC 4x4 fully loaded.  It was used with 10000 miles.  I had read before that people claim it drives like a sports car and it really does.  It is a blast to drive.  I have also been very pleasantly surprised with how smooth the ride is even on the worst freeways (and even with the Nismo package).  It has lots of room in the back seat and a roof that rises so that taller people can sit in the back seat without hitting their head.  Transmission is smooth power plentiful.  Rockford fosgate sound system is terrific.  This truck is tough it looks great and it drives nice.  What more could one ask for?  Fuel economy is not bad for a truck.,

Easy to park and get out of tuff parking spots. Sits high enough to allow you to see ahead of avg. autos on road today. I belive it may be one of the safer trucks on the road.,

2004,14-05-2006,2,0,3.875, This small truck was exactly what I needed for a new sales job inexpensive small some carring ability and good gas milage.  I have been back to the dealer twice to fix a noise in rear when braking problem still exists.  Fun and semi peppy to drive sporty feel.  It should be faster for a 2400cc 16 valve engine Gas mileage was 22 I thought it should be better for a 4 cylinder mini truck K&N air filter and Flowmaster exaust improved it by 10%. ,

2004,01-01-2016,1,0.1531,5, My grandfather bought this truck new from the dealership in 2004. The whole time he owned it through my childhood and teen years it was phenomenal and still is today. Recently due to medical issues he had to give up driving and the truck went to me. It is still the the magnificent truck it was the day he brought it home. My wife and I own a small hobby farm and we use it frequently for hauling feed supplies produce animals and just about anything else you can think of. It's easy to maintain very simplistic in that there is not a lot of electronics to fail and the gas mileage is unbelievable. We recently took a trip from our home in Western Maryland to the Adirondack Mountains in upstate NY and the truck averaged 34mpg for the trip and that was with the bed loaded with camping gear. When my grandfather bought this truck he traded in a 1984 Nissan truck for it which had 483000 miles on it an I expect that and so much more out of this beautiful piece of machinery. If you have the opportunity to purchase a 1st gen (1998-2004) Nissan Frontier with the bulletproof 2.4L KA24DE engine get it. It will be the best investment you'll ever make.,
2004,23-04-2016,2,0.9495,5, This is my second Frontier. I've had this one for 11 years. These are great small trucks. I just wish it got better mileage. ,
2004,30-10-2010,4,0.8658,4.375,Both trucks had problems with tailgate lock in both trucks.,
2004,05-08-2012,3,-0.4019,4.375, Bought new in 2004 for 17700. 95K miles and no problems. Replaced OEM tires at 55K with same (BFG's) and battery died in 2008 replaced front brake pads around 60K. No other problems just oil changes. 18-20MPG consistently. Wanted something I could keep for a few years with little to no issue and this has been great. Definitely a 'truck' ride especially on bumpy roads and interior starting to feel small but overall it's been a fantastic truck never let me down. ,
2004,15-11-2015,4,0.3612,5,Ride height (Desert Runner is 2WD on 4WD chassis). Reliability.,
2004,23-11-2012,4,0,5, I owned this truck for about five years. The best truck I ever had. Looks good and is a conversation piece.,
2004,29-01-2016,1,0.7964,5,It is just a good looking truck all over.,
2004,25-01-2006,1,0.4404,4, You won't get 50 mpg with this truck.  It is after all a truck.  I got 14-15 mpg combined gas mile p/gallon with a fully loaded bed (1000 lbs.)!!!  (a homemade camper lives on the bed).  Otherwise about 18-20 mpg.  I bought this truck used about 4 years ago.  It is 12-years-old now.  I put in a new battery and a set of great tires.  I do the scheduled maintenance.  That's it!  It always starts always runs.  No issues.  Reliable.  Solid.,
2004,27-05-2010,2,0.6876,4, Overall a cheap truck both good and bad. Engine torque performance at start up and pulling grades was poor especially with a load.  Number 2 plug wire was against a metal bracket and shorting out intermitently for first 5000 miles once repositioned performance became marginal.  Traction has been very poor when unloaded until it resulted in a crash into a road bank at 15 mph and $5K of damage. Have now replaced the original 225/70 tires with 205/70 tires.  So far that change has proven to be useful wet and dry traction seems to have improved and the torque/gearing now is acceptable.  The speedo/odometer of course is off now as nissan offers no adjustment.,
2004,01-04-2009,2,-0.577,4.625,Cheap and new good quality.,
2004,27-04-2009,2,0.4404,4.5, I am about to hit 100k miles today (XE V6 4WD Crew Cab 5 speed).  Haven't had a problem yet and I've worked it hard.  There aren't even any rattles in the interior. It'll tow an 18' boat haul a yard of stone plow snow and commute to work. The ride handling and build quality are much better than my previous truck a Toyota Tacoma. As far as mileage I have seen 21mpg when driving with a light touch on the highway but it's mostly 18-20mpg. It's certaintly no worse than any other compact pickup on the market.  I did install a Magnaflow exhaust and K&N filtercharger which helped with throttle response. Overall I couldn't really ask for more from a truck.,
2004,20-12-2016,4,-0.8111,4,Utility reliability smooth ride. ,
2004,13-02-2004,1,0,4.75,A little room in the back seat area would be appreciated.,
2004,18-07-2006,3,0.5106,3.5, I have owned this truck since new and it has been a very reliable vehicle.   The acceleration is not very good and the back seats are fairly cramped for the average adult but fine for kids.   The mpg is also very average.  I know some full size truck owners who probably get as good MPG with more space.  The rear doors also do not open up wide enough(only about 45 degrees).   However having said all that this truck has been rock solid in terms of reliability and that is important to most people.  The truck is a 5 passenger vehicle and it does have a 6 foot bed.   The truck is very good in the snow.  Tires brakes and basic maintenance like oil changes air filters transmission flush etc are the only things I've had done.   I would say the truck was a very good value for the dollar at the time when bought brand new in 2004 which included the roof rack(which comes in handy) power windows power door locks cruise control  bed linerand cd player.   I would not hesitate to buy a used frontier if the previous owner took decent care of it.,

2007,21-09-2011,3,0.5499,4.75, I love this truck. My brother has the 2door Nismo and I drove it for a weekend and fell in love. I needed the 4 door for my 2 kids. (no nismo needed here either),

2007,07-01-2007,1,0,4.5,I haven't towed anything yet(but I have no fear of under-performing). Very comfortable compared to other trucks. Read the reviews out there and you will find this is the best truck in it's class.,
2007,12-07-2010,3,0.5256,5,I purchased used at 45K miles so we'll see how reliable this thing is. ,
2007,26-02-2012,1,0,2.75,Great looking truck fast off the line very capable 4x4 comfortable interior and feel of high quality materials(unlike Chevy/GMC Canyon).,
1999,12-04-2005,2,0.8899,4.125, I have had my Frontier for about 1 1/2 months. I love it. The 4WD is dependable and very stable. I have had it in a very soupy cornfield near my house and it pulled out with no problems. The gas mileage leaves something to be desired. I get about 18 mpg on the highway. It is comfortable on short trips however it is a bit short for my 6 foot frame. The engine is strong and reliable. Nice truck!!!,

1999,01-07-2009,3,-0.3595,4.5," I purchased this truck for over-the- road traveling. It has been a terrific truck for me. I have used it for some limited hauling. I am not a small guy. It is very comfortable for me. I would have liked 4 doors and the cruise control ""on"" button is in a strange place. That is the only thing that has been an issue for me. The comfort reliability and the build of this truck is second to none. The styling is far superior to any of the competition. My truck looks more beefy with more design while the others look more boxy and cheap. I would recommend this truck to anyone. Who ever gets this truck next even with 150000 miles will get a very nice looking truck and one that is mechanically so",
1999,15-01-2006,1,0.9544,5, There is no better truck in the world. This truck is running just as good as the day i bought it and shows no sign of wear. during the worst ice storm my area has ever seen last year the truck ran over every tree that blocked my way. after some drunk guy smashed into the side of it and hit the rear wheel dead on going 50mph the truck started right up and took me home. when i took it to be repaired we found out the leaf springs had blown apart....and it still took me home. i love this truck and when this truck finally dies if it ever does i will buy another. ,
1999,22-06-2005,2,-0.743,4.5,Durability reliability comfort design how it looks as it passes those chevy's and fords that hit 100000 miles and die. really does make chevy trucks look like a rock. ,

1999,16-02-2004,1,0.2498,4.75, This truck runs great.  No engine problems or design flaws.  It would however be nice if it had four doors instead of two.  Also the engine could use a little more guts putting out 160 horsepower and 200 ft/lbs of torque. Other then that great truck.  It uses 90% of its horsepower at 1800 rpm and less so passing on the highway can take time.  This truck will make you happy.  ,

1999,22-03-2002,1,-0.2584,4.375, I purchased my truck new in 1999. I only  have about 65000 miles on it. I have not had a single problem with it in all these years. The air conditioner is just as cold today as it was the day I drove it off the lot. The car has not been back to the dealership since I bought it. I do change the oil/filter about every 5000 miles. It still runs like a sewing machine. Gas mileage is about 19 in town and 24 on the highway (65 mph). Did have to replace factory radio.,

Now that I have had it smogged and can drive it to have the transmission checked...I find out the transmission needs to be rebuilt. $2400 minimum. This thing has cost me almost 6000 so far and barely has 100000 miles on it. ,
2005,11-07-2016,3,0,5,The dealer and Nissan USA both gave me the bird on every issue. Nissan sux,

2005,13-05-2005,2,-0.7003,5, This is a work truck for me and I spend a lot of time on the road. The seats are comfortable and the layout of the interior is very clean. It has plenty of power starts and runs smooth. I have been getting around 18.3MPG in town and 22MPG Highway. The only problem I have had was a rattle noise from the engine. I took the truck in there was a TSB for the noise they ordered the part and the truck was fixed.,

2005,03-02-2010,1,0,4.125, Currently have about 92k. I love this truck.  I have owned it for 4 years.  I beat the crap out of this truck.  Smashed it twice and i drive it like i stole it.  Never had any problems till recently.  Catalytic converter on Drivers side went out on it at 83K just out of emissions warranty. Nissan wanted $1200 i did it myself on the ground for about $250.  Now if having some sort of vibration coming from the transmission almost like the torque converter lockup is not engaging correctly.  My Gibson Exhaust rusted through and i ended up puttin a banks exhaust on it.  I bought it for the power boy does this truck move.  Ive raced with it and ive run it through the mud. Cant beat a Frontier.,

2005,22-08-2016,3,0.6597,3, Purchased the Frontier brand new for $26000 in Jan 2006. At 40k miles the left side catalytic convertor went out. Had it replaced under 60k mile power train warranty. At 50k miles the right side catalytic convertor went out. At 75k miles the transmissions clunks out. Thank the lord I was still under a new extended 80k miles warranty for the tranny. 100k miles the cam shaft sensor went out leaving me stranded. Only Nissans shut off on you in the middle of the road and do not start when their sensors go out. Another 10k miles and the crank shaft sensor went out. 110k miles the gas meter went dead. I'm currently at 140k miles and both of my lower o2 sensors need replacing as the check engine light came and the diagnosis stated so. I will never buy another Nissan ever again. Except for a Z of course!!!,
2005,29-01-2006,1,-0.7074,4, Overall this has been a great truck to own. it's fun and easy to drive with almost sporty handling and a very strong drivetrain. The driving position is comfortably upright with good all round visibility easy controls and ample room for a six footer. Rear seats are cramped even for kids but there's good usable space back there for additional cargo. The utili-track bed system and factory applied bed liner are very practical. I don't know why all trucks don't have this as standard. The dealer took care of some initial interior rattles but otherwise the truck has performed flawlessly. Hard interior plastics are showing there age already. Average real fuel economy is 17MPG 14 City 22HWY.,
2005,10-07-2010,3,0.9661,2.875,Lusty V6 and smooth responsive auto put many V8 trucks to shame while returning a real-world 17+ MPG average. Solid feel responsive steering comfortable driving position and a tolerable ride keep you happy behind the wheel. Very usable cargo space and just-right size. Many safety features  ,
2005,19-01-2005,1,0.9062,4.75,Complaints are generally few unless you're a detail person like myself Interior fit and finish generally disappoints. The hard plastics scratch easily and consequently are aging quickly which won't help resale value. Likewise with exterior fit and paint seems thin scratches and chips easily. ,
2005,05-06-2006,2,0.3195,4.375, I had high hopes for this truck when I got it.  It was my first brand new vehicle.  From the very first day I had problems with it.  Ranging from a broken steering column to bad tires leaky windshield brake problems and the list goes on.  I have lost countless hours of work going to get it fixed for a bunch of different reasons.  My truck currently has 29000 miles and doesn't work.  I've gone through 3 different batteries.  The truck turns off while driving or it won't turn on at all.  I was getting charged over $1000 to replace abs module but it looks like that isn't the problem or it may be a problem but it seems that it is another problem why it won't turn on.,
2003,29-01-2005,1,0.6967,4.5, I LOVE this truck! I initially wanted this vehicle because of the aggressive styling but ultimately bought it for the value and practicality. Even for a small V6 it can move if it needs to. I don't have the same mileage issue as most people (I get about 20 per gal) and I have a bit of a lead foot. No mechanical troubles except that the check engine light went on when I put on a locking gas cap. With the birth of my second child I found that the backseat can't handle an infant carseat without squishing the front passenger. Still I only paid $17500 including the optional power and sport packages so this is truly the best vehicle I have ever had for the money. ,
2003,10-11-2002,4,0.8835,4.375,Super fun to drive nice options and very practical.,
2003,24-06-2003,2,0.875,4.75,More room in the backseat better customer service at the dealerships. They treat you like dirt AFTER you've already bought the vehicle. They charged me $80 to reset the check engine light and after reading the manual I found that the light would have reset itself after changing the gas cap back.,

2003,07-10-2014,4,0,4.125, When I was looking for a truck I needed something that I could get into relatively cheap that I could haul my motorcycle around with and last a long time. After doing lots of research I decided on the Frontier. I bought the truck with 75k on it 2 years ago and it currently has just under 100k.  The previous owner took good care of it and gave me a bunch of maintenance receipts and so far it's been trouble free except for a bad knock sensor but that doesn't really effect anything. That said it's not very powerful and it drinks gas like a V8. It should have had a 6 speed but with this truck you trade power and efficiency for reliability. If your Ok with that then it's great.,

I am sort of a shade tree mech. & the ease of changing brakes oil filters etc. was actually surprising. Thank you Nissan for a truck with great style & performance.

2003,28-05-2007,2,0,4.75," I bought my Nissain Frontier new in November 2003.  I've owned Toyota Chevy (Luv) Mazda Ford small pickups.  I like to have a small truck.  If you need a heavy hauler get a full size truck.  I've put 65000 miles on the truck and have not had a single problem.  It tows a trailer with ease and goes from city to highway driving with ease.  It's quieter on the Highway than my Honda Odyssey.  I get 20 mpg in the city and 24 on the highway which is better gas mileage than most get.  Only bad I can say the A/C compresser has always had a bone chilling ""clang"" when it kicks in.  ",
2003,02-04-2008,2,0.7779,4.125,Versatile truck.  Ride and handling. Very dependable!,
2001,01-09-2015,3,0,5," First off I don't write reviews but i thought I would make an exception. I bought my 2001 ad crew cab used in 2003 with about 30k on the clock. I have it a 3 inch lift and a few other mods fast forward to 2015 and I still have the truck 190k now and it still gets compliments and it still runs great. I would not hesitate to drive it anywhere in fact I still use it to go on road trips across multiple states some times towing a travel trailer it has held up well. I thought I would write this review because I've seen people say ""I'll never buy a Nissan again"" ""my toyota never had problems"" and that may be true however I also have a 1990 hardbody that I bought used in 97 and it now is approaching the 300k Mark and other than 2 clutches and a timing chain it's still running great and i also have two very good friends who both have toyotas both with 22re and both didn't make it very far past 145k before a rebuild was in order now I'm not digging toyota I believe they make good vehicles and quite honestly that's what I originally wanted to buy but I am far happier with my nissans. They have been super reliable you will usually see the reviews of people who think they have been wronged somehow and things do happen but I have owned 4 kids and and they are very reliable. Love my frontier it's been my daily driver for 12 yearsand just now the leather seat is starting to wear out supercharger is still original. It does not leak or burn anything the gas mileage would be my only complaint. I average 15mpg but I also have larger tires...can't say enough good things about the truck",
2001,04-09-2010,3,0.9965,4.875, I bought my truck in 2001. my registration date was 9-11.  This truck got 94000 on original tires.  105000 on brakes. 160000 and counting on the clutch.  I just took off the seat covers and the seats are like brand new.  I'm giving the truck to my son and I believe he will continue to enjoy it.  I just got the front wheel alignment done for the first time last week.  Mostly freeway miles but I have taken it in the mountains and to the ocean.  I got 24 miles to the gallon but I had to cruise at 63 miles an hour to do it.  If you put 89 octane in it you will get the 27 miles a gallon they claim. And you get to go 65 miles an hour.  I will miss this vehicle.,
2001,06-04-2010,2,0.5267,4.625,I liked the looks the interior the handling the bed length.  I have avoided tons of accidents do to its visibility.  And the engine torque is perfect for down hill rolling. ,
2001,29-01-2012,1,0.4215,5,"I think they had it right with the size of this vehicle and wish they would have made this the standard size for the Nissan ""datsun"" truck.  Just like our economy got to big the vehicles did too.",
2001,12-02-2012,1,0.6369,5, Bought brand-new.  Went into dealership to purchase another type of vehicle could not make a deal and asked if they had any of the new super-charged pick-ups.  Drove it bought it and 9 years later have no regrets.  It's the most fun vehicle to drive and the workmanship and paint of the vehicle have been outstanding.  Turned out the dealer I bought it from was the best I have ever dealt with.,
1998,15-05-2016,2,0.8439,5, I bought this truck from a Nissan Service Tech. with 35000 miles on it. Little did I know that he had put some Firestone recalled tires on it and I had a blowout at 6000 miles. Tread was at 60%. Then clutch started acting up. I did the job myself after Nissan quoted $2200. When I dropped the tranny about 2 quarts of water poured out. Some genius on the assembly line completely sealed the bell housing. All the clutch components were rusted. Don't buy from Nissan buy from Phoenix Friction. Replaced the flywheel rear main seal clutch etc.  If you have a Nissan manual tranny crawl under with a 1/4 drill bit and poke a hole in the 6:00 position in the bell housing. It should be clear. Other than that the truck is by far the best 4 wheel drive vehicle I have driven. I go where others fear to go. Great hunting and off road vehicle.,
1998,23-06-2009,2,0.8271,4.625, Yes the 4 cyl is underpowered but I am not in a hurry going up hills. The engineer at Nissan who positioned the PCV valve (requires taking off most of the front engine components to change it) should be horsewhipped. ,
1998,11-03-2002,1,0.2144,4.25,Seems all the headliners during those years failed. I re-upholstered mine for about $50.00 plus added some middle supports which cured the sagging. I reduced the road noise by adding sound deadner in the doors and behind the headlines. 50% reduction in road noise.,
1998,06-09-2009,3,-0.2023,4.875, I bought my Frontier in 2004 when I was 18.  Been driving it almost daily ever since.  I've done trips of well over 400 miles as well as put it through some rigorous Off-Road and Mud trails.  The truck has gone everywhere I've pointed it.  Ran into a few trees and rocks while wheeling body damage was fixed with a little hammer work.  I was rear ended in it with barely a dent to the rear bumper (the plastic step came loose.) The little toyota pickup that hit me was destroyed.  Power is perfectly fine It's a pickup not a race car.  I'm running 31 in. tires (compared to the stock size of about 17 in.) and it runs perfectly fine with no life required.  In all great truck!,
1998,17-10-2008,4,0.8718,4.75,fender well size to fit larger tired. Plenty of power on and off road and good 4Lo power. good strong IFS suspension and drivetrain. Lack of repairs needed.  If your Frontier needs excessive repairs then you're an idiot driver who doesn't know how to take care of your average maintenance.,
1998,06-01-2012,1,0.8126,3.5, I bought this truck in 2010 in the 4WD exteded cab thinking it would be reliable and i wanted decent gas milage for a truck. It had 140000 miles on it and the gas milage was not as good as i hped it would be average about 19 mpg. I will say that the 4WD works very good in the snow. For a while it was fine then slowly small things started to fail on it. These were not the end of the world but they were annoying. Finally the transmission went out on me on a road trip at 155000 miles. I do not know if it was due to a fluid leak or if it just happened. But the repair will be very expensive since they only made it for two years and it comes as a unit with the transfer case.,

1998,10-03-2008,1,-0.4019,4.25,The power window switch became so hard to roll up that most people thought they broke it.

And soon after i got it the handle to pull the passenger seat forward became very tricky to use.,

2000,21-03-2002,1,-0.3182,4.625, Maybe I'm just used to boxy SUVs. I replaced my '92 Pathfinder SEV6 with the Crew Cab Frontier SEV6. Bad mistake. The handling was less than I expected. The ABS would abruptly kick in wet conditions. Short-bed was neat until I needed to put something big back there. Cramped and plain interior. Stock CD player would malfunction when it got too warm from long operation. Poor traction and ugly cloth seat fabric. I liked the unique exterior look though for its time. Traded it in after the second accident involving the terrible 4WD traction. Owned it for a year.  Nissan was once my favorite automaker however they take a second or even fifth seat after owning such a bad vehicle. I still see their current models could use a tad more luster in their designs.,
2000,04-04-2012,2,-0.9062,4.125, very nice truck just bought it a year a go and has not given me problems....no oil leaks no nothing ... fun to drive .... not a fan of the windows since there manual ... but engine and trans is good ,

2000,25-05-2004,2,0,4.625, I purchased my Nissan Frontier crew cab 4wd in Feb of 2000.  I still have the truck with just shy of 80k miles on it and it is still going strong. It has not required any major or even minor mechanical work aside from the usual things like new brake pads filters and tires. All in all this is the absolute best vehicle I have ever purchased for reliability and functionality. This is the first time for me as a car owner where I am certain that when my current Frontier eventually fails I will happily buy another one just like it. :),

2000,09-05-2010,2,0,4.25, Bought this truck used in 2001 it had 36000 on it. Paid $10500. It's been a great truck very reliable I currently have 165000 miles on it and runs great. Fuel economy not so good 17-18 mpg. Tires last a long time with no alignment needed just rotate and balance. I've used Amsoil Synthetics in it for years and change the oil every 15000 miles. I use it as a service truck in my business and it's been a good work horse.,
2000,27-05-2011,2,0.2366,5,Reliable and durable.,
2000,05-02-2011,1,0,4,Cooling system should be larger have had issues with it. Uncomfortable ride but it's a truck. Rear spark plug very difficult to replace. Tail gate issues. Could use more hp for hauling.,
2000,26-03-2014,1,-0.4835,4.875, My dads 2000 nissan frontier 4x4 4 cyl manual has been the most reliable truck he bought it new it has 260000 miles everything in the truck is still all original has never been touched same water pumpsame thermostatsame clutch and pressure plate you name it its still all there. except for a cracked exhaust manifold i just replace a couple days ago. its been beat up bad its been threw water up to the hood waters coming in the truck but does not burn any oil at all for almost 300000 miles no truck could ever last and have been beat up as this one has.,
2000,02-02-2010,1,-0.6375,4.625, I use to be a Chevy guy but Nissan knows how to build cars and trucks. Being my third Nissan the Frontier is a overall really good truck. The V6 engine could use a little more power but it gets the job done. It's now at 98000 miles and still runs like new. I did have to replace the exhaust manifolds due to cracks and the battery died after the 6th year. I do all the repairs myself so it hasn't cost me much. I am now planning on replacing the timing belt water pump and hoses. I have already replaced the O2's plugs wires cap and rotor along with the drive belts since I am a strong believer in preventive maintenance. Truck has proven to be highly reliable and still performs like new. ,
2009,20-10-2008,4,0.8196,4.125," Technology is amazing on this car - almost over the top but when you add it all up this car flat out delivers. Engine is phenomenal with gobs of power and a flat torque curve. The two small IHI turbos spool up very quickly so the car feels more like a V-8 than a juiced six. The DCT shifts smoothly in norm and comfort modes and bangs swift and hard in race mode. Note I downrated the ""fun to drive"" category because this car is deadly serious and one has to be very attentive to the power and the braking both of which are amazing. My S2000 was more fun to drive but I do not regret buying the GT-R one bit. It gets a lot of attention everywhere I go and I like stealth but I am happy.",
2009,29-09-2008,3,0.98,4.625,Minimal turbo lag super attention to detail especially leather dash and door bits. Braking is stunning - I have to run red lights in fear that no other car behind me can stop as quickly as I can. Build quality is very good. Underside of car is completely sealed to reduce drag which at .27 is low.,
2015,24-11-2014,4,-0.3197,4.625, This is by a wide margin the best car I have ever had (or even been in).  As an engineer I am amazed at this car and what it can do.,
2015,20-06-2014,2,0.8126,5,First the downsides (which are far surpassed by it's positive qualities.  It does not like to go slow (neither do I).  At speeds under 30 or so the transmission makes strange noises and the steering is a little rough.  The suspension even in comfort mode would not allow you to to surgery in the back seat.  And if you ever can temporarily give up driving this car you better watch out for curbs.  The ground clearance would make a mouse do the limbo.,
2015,19-04-2014,2,0.6623,5,But that is not what this car was engineered for.  It is an absolute thrill to drive.,
2012,12-12-2011,4,0.3612,4.625, My first choice was the tacoma but it was at least $7K more with the same option. I test drove both. I like the look of the tacoma better but the price was just way too high. I ended buying the frontier because I got it $4K less than the MSRP. Now with the frontier the handling and power is great. I took it off road already and it handled it very well. MPG is about 15 on the city. I have not driven it on the highway that often to check the mpg. ,
2012,25-04-2012,2,0.9504,4.75,If you are looking for a 4x4 truck the pro-4x is the best deal under $30K out of the door. I shopped everywhere. I checked Rams f150 tacoma and all others. Price reliability and handling are the main reasons I chose the frontier.,

2012,09-12-2012,4,0,4.875, I have only around 2k miles on the truck right now but wanted to give my 2 cents on it. I looked at every other player on the market and it wasn't even close. On paper I thought the ridgeline would be the best until I drove it. You hit the gas and all you can hear is engine noise. The speed-o hardy would move. So the Tacoma. My last truck was a late 90's tacoma and just went on and on and on. So I thought for sure that would work. Nope. The seats are crap and I got in the back seat and my head hit ceiling. I'm only 6'1. So that was out. So save yourself time and get Nissan. With rebates fully loaded pro-x leather ext 27k with rebates.,
2014,21-03-2017,1,0.9436,5, There is no finer automobile to scoot down the road at 100+ for extended drives.,
2014,13-12-2015,4,-0.296,2, Engine idles rough  lot of vibration . Front seat rattles dealer repaired  still rattles. Climate control difficult to regulate . Slow to warm in the winter. Wanders from side to side  loud when driving .,
2014,13-09-2015,3,-0.1531,5," I had a 2004 Frontier king cab.  It was spartan and handled kind of rough but the thing was a tank and I had very little problems with it.  I traded it in at a 170k miles.  Having kids I knew I needed more of an actual back seat I got a used 2014 Frontiet sv trim line crew cab.  So far I love it!  The V6 engine has great ""gitty-up"" and power.  It's handling/turning may not be its strong suit but it's a truck not a sports car.  Not sure this is most truck's strong suits.  Overall I love the look of truck sporty and brawny while maintaining some refinement.  Understand that this is a mid-size vehicle so there are lots of bigger trucks with way more cargo and back seat space.  But not wanting a school bus sized vehicle for a truck this is a perfect size.  Certainly if you do lots of hauling especially heavy duty look elsewhere.  But for around town with some hauling this truck fits the bill.  Also some people knock the mpg but again it's a truck!",
2014,30-08-2015,3,0.9724,4, Bought this as a more cost effective and less 'garage filling' replacement for my 2000 Silverado. Interior fit and finish is great good visibility and lots of power. A/C works well which is appreciated in TX. Cons: this truck gets 16.5 MPG city and about 20.5 highway - way less than my old 4.8 L Silverado which got 19.5/23 over 170K miles with a larger and more powerful engine. The Frontier is a miserable highway truck as you have to compensate for every little wind gust and it will hydroplane easily compared to the other trucks I have owned. There is also a 'clunk' in the driveline which I have noted in not only my but other Frontiers when taking off from a stop. Still it is a good value for an 'in town hauler' if you do not need a longer 6' bed.,
2014,23-04-2015,2,0.9437,3," I purchased my 2014 Nissan Frontier Pro 4x brand new 01/11/14. I have 53567 miles on it already and will tell you this never buy Nissan! on board computer-junk locks up loses connection with my phone and the whole ""pay attention to the road"" sign could not be more irritating! I drive mostly highway on cruise control...I have NEVER seen 21 MPG EVER!! The most important factor in selecting this vehical. They somehow neglect to inform you when you purchase the truck of all the mileage related ""maintenance"" that needs performed. In the 15 months I have owned the truck the dealers have soaked me for over $2000.00!! REALLY!!? I still need tires!  ",
2014,05-11-2015,4,-0.3976,5,"I now have 110000 on the truck. The computer is still junk and they want $150 to upgrade the map. I haven't gotten the 100000 maintenance yet and my wallet is terrified. The serpentine belt is squealing quite loudly and with all the internal fluids that will I'm sure ""need changed"" I have no doubt a $1000+ bill is in my future. ",
2011,05-06-2010,2,-0.7269,4.75, Had my gtr about month now and love it. I had many cars coming from an Audi rs4 e55 m3 Corvette and I have to tell you this car blows them out the door in looks and build quality. The handling and the power that is on tap in every gear is amazing. Only downside is it drives hard but I guess what can you expect from a super car that handles the way it does. Do not buy this car if you don't like attention. Gas stations lights  everywhere people ask how I like the car and what a sweet car it is. I bought the White. I live in New Jersey where the roads are terrible ton of pot holes so I need to b careful. If you are blessed to live in Florida or Cali. You will enjoy this car with the great road.,

2011,27-06-2010,2,0.128,3,suspension is hard but i guess i live in new jersey with terrible roads unfortunately.other than that cant think of one.,
2010,30-01-2017,1,-0.6542,5, I bought this car used Feb 2014.   It was completely stock and had 42000 miles.  I have drive the car learned all I can about it and tastefully modified it over the past 3 years and the car truly is amazing.  There really has not been any negatives for me the car is a little harsh in the handling and I from what I understand is the newer models have made the ride a little easier.  But after all this is a track ready sports car so that is to be expected!  The car has been reliable and fun to drive and it never lets down in the performance department.  Only bad thing I can think of is the car continues to get more expensive every year it is released.,
2010,14-11-2009,4,0.8478,4.875, This car is all that you've probably heard it is and much more.  I've owned a Premium 2010 GTR since June of '09 and it continues to amaze me every day as it's my daily driver.  AWD handling both on and off track is amazing as it the smoothness and quickness of the gearbox when you shift with paddles in manual mode.  Not a cushy soft ride at all but that's not what I want or expect in a racecar like this.  For my tastes the exterior is absolutely stunning in design with the hood resembling an Aston Martin and the rear end (my fav part of the car) reminding me a bit of a F-430.  I find the electronics inside are excellent and the build quality is superb.  Hats off to Nissan--brilliant.,
2010,03-08-2009,3,0.9801,5,Acceleration at any speed is blistering.  Top end still has some torque left when you're on the track pushing it hard.  You cannot believe the speeds this car lets you take corners at either.  A true sportscar for driving enthusiasts.,
2010,13-06-2009,2,0.6808,5,Allow downloads of performance data to a CF card for track day use.  Also stereo system (Bose is stock) could be better.  Mechanically though ZERO complaints.,
2010,13-05-2009,2,0.2732,5, Purchased the car in June and have put on about 2500 kms. I find the ride a bit harsh even at comfort and the radio complex. I have amost covered the performance envelope with the fuel consumption of 20 mpg or 13.8 L/100km ave. The fuel burn rate was high to start with but with the brakes bedded in lowered considerably. The performance is good with only one surprise. Car pulls to the left when distracted by a pothole at about 50kph. I had a 300ZTT before and this provides all the fun and some. Get a lot of looks as it is the second in town. I have an S-Type R that is a pussy cat compared with the GTR. I rate the GT-R 12 out of 10. It should have been the new 380Z,
2010,23-03-2013,1,0.7845,5,Performance brakes and vehicle visibility. Fuel consumption is as posted by Nissan.  ,
2016,13-04-2017,2,0,4, Juke's are an absolute blast to drive so we just purchased our second a 2016 new with 1000 dealer miles on it. We didn't even take it for a test drive since it is essentially the same car as our 2012 Juke.  BIG MISTAKE!!! For some reason this one is a DOG when you step on the gas. We alerted the dealer and they are going to take a look. We suspect possibly bad gas from sitting on the lot for so long but unsure until they check it out. Crossing our fingers that this car will be as fun and worry free as our first Juke once we get this initial hiccup straightened out.,

2016,27-05-2017,2,0,5, My Juke is just fabulous! I quite like the interior lighting on the floor the lighted Juke logo on the threshold by the doors. It's a fast zippy car very economical to run but is a bit small for a family car. It's a one person car,
2016,08-12-2016,4,0.5249,4," I LOVE MY JUKE!!!  I realize this car won't be for everyone so let's get the obvious negatives out of the way first;  Cargo space is limited (but there is a split folding for extra room).  The back seat is not for adults especially on longer journeys (headroom as well as leg room will be tight).  There is a blind spot that requires more attention when you are changing lanes.  The ride is a little stiff and road noise can be annoying at times.  Now let's get to the good stuff!  This car is sporty really sporty.  The 4 cylinder turbo charged engine will do 0-60 in 7 secs this would rival some 2 door coupes.  The CVT is responsive and I have no trouble accelerating when I want to and there is an option to shift up or down via the center gear lever (if you want/need to have that control).  The steering is right on point and super responsive and you can ""feel the road"" in the steering wheel.  I live in Colorado and the Juke is a blast in the snow!  It has 7 inches of clearance so you won't have to worry about ""plowing"" through deep snow with your front end and the AWD works like a champ.  The AWD does everything I could ask it to and you can switch it to FWD only if you want to save on gas mileage.  Speaking of gas mileage I average 34 MPG in this thing and I live in the city.  The bluetooth as well as the voice command system work well and calls through the speaker system come in clear.  Bottomline:  I have two young kids and came from a coupe.  Having 4 doors as great and they will not outgrow the back seats for at least 6 or 7 years from now.  I don't need a lot of cargo space (we have my wife's vehicle for that).  For me this car is a perfect combination of what I want.  It is fun great on gas amazing in the snow and reliable (10yr/100000 mile bumper to bumper and lifetime powertrain warranties).  If you are looking for a vehicle to commute in that looks fantastic you will not find ANYTHING else that is this good for the price you pay!",
2016,24-10-2016,4,0.9944,4, I LOVE my juke.  My favorite attribute is the ruby red accents that adorne the interior including the seats and insides of the doors,
2016,03-04-2017,2,0.8374,4, I love the spunk of this car! And especially the custom colorization. Since I was purchasing the car I purchased all of the color accents that I could. The car is a beautiful dark blue with red accents. I get compliments on the car daily. Everyone loves the look of it and especially the color accents. I previously has a Cadillac ATS and before that a Caddy CTS. Obviously both of the Caddys road smoother. But frankly I got tired of the exorbitant repair and maintenance bills on cars that were only a few years old. Also there was so much technology on the Caddy's that it was constantly in the shop. One even a needed a new transmission when it was just 4 years old. So I was looking to downsize have a car with less electronics better mileage and just a simpler ride. The Juke is all of that and more! I can't say enough about how happy I am. I purchased it in June of 2016 and it really does get 30 mpg. And I have had no problems in the 10 months I've had it verses the probably 8 times the Cadillac was in for service during the first year. Often the service visits were recalls or simple technological glitches but frankly I don't think a new car should be in the shop at all in its first few years. And that's the case with my Juke. Yes the back seat is small but it is typically just me and my husband and my mom and I fit in the back just fine. Yes the trunk space is smaller than my previous car but the seats lie down easily so it's actually better then than before. Love love love it! Thank you Nissan for a solid sporty car that spends more time on the road and less time in the shop.,
2016,16-09-2016,3,0.9944,4, Do your work on pricing...there is more room than you think,
2016,04-08-2016,3,0,4," I test drove a couple of Jukes and really liked them.  However they seemed to have a lot of road noise.  This was the only reason I did not buy one.  I would also like for the ""pigtail"" on top to go away.  I think the ""pigtails"" on the top of vehicles looks dorky.",
2009,07-02-2009,1,0.8016,5, I researched this car for over a year against BMW M3 Mercedes C63 AMG Audi RS4 Corvette Z06 and I was coming from a WRX STi and I kid you not this car does it all. I had heard that it had a hard ride and was noisy but it is not the case. It handles beautifully and turns immediately when you want it to.The power is indescribable and the sound of the car in my opinion is just right (V8s are overrated). The interior is quality crafted and it has all the modern tech you could need or want. Do not buy if you need usable rear seats. It does better MPG than my STi did and the sound system is great. You had also better get used to the attention you will receive because they are so rare. The BEST,

2009,15-08-2008,3,0,4, I have had my GTR for 4 months. There is an unnamed river road that is windy twisty and has dips. There are even a few straight lines. This road brings out the best in this vehicle. It will stick like glue easily handling anything I can dish out. Amazing! It is also my daily driver. Taking off slowly in first was initially unsettling but you get used to it. Excellent sound system.A car like this was a dream for me. I'm really a Porsche guy but the price of a late model turbo is out of my reach. But the GTR is the finest performance machine I've ever driven.,
2009,01-11-2009,4,0.9592,4.5,Update,

2012,19-02-2013,1,0.7579,4.75,Regarding MPG with one week of ownership what I found out is the following.,
2012,12-03-2015,1,0,4,If the car is driven as a small turbo punchy nimble car meant to be driven my commute (60% HWY 40% Local) gives about 22~23 MPG.,
2012,30-11-2012,4,0,4,But if I drive like my mother is sitting next to me I was able to get 33~34 MPG on the same route.,
2016,20-12-2015,4,0.3612,4, I originally bought a 2015 SV V6 2WD King Cab (in May 2015).  After using it for 6 months it became obvious there was not enough room in the cab when I needed to carry passengers.  I was also a little disappointed with the lack of features I have become accustomed to in my new vehicles - heated  seats compass outside temp rear camera............,
2016,05-04-2016,2,-0.6258,5,While the reviews of this 2015 vehicle were not outstanding I was happy (overall) with my truck.  It was fairly noisy but it fit my expectations of a truck.  (I want to be able to carry stuff with reasonable expectations for performance and reliability.),
2016,30-11-2015,4,0.0621,5,So after getting a reluctant nod from my wife I bought the same truck as a 2016 (November 2015).  However this time it was a 4 door SV with the value truck package.,
2016,05-08-2016,3,0.0352,5,This version is much more usable with less road noise. Gas mileage is not outstanding but it's not rediculous (as you might expect from the reviews).  I get 20 mpg consistently (combined). The features and controls work well and are simple to use.  However they may be somewhat dated in their design.  Again they honestly meet my expectations for a truck.,
2016,27-03-2016,1,0.6747,5,I did look at the new Chevy when I bought the 2015.  The dealers were unwilling to negotiate on the price and there were few vehicles available on the lot.  There were no Toyota's available in a 2WD and the dealers were even less willing to negotiate about the price. ,
2016,14-07-2016,3,-0.296,5, This is 4 wheel vehicle ,33 (+12 motorcycles).   Last truck was 2009 Toyota Tacoma standard cab 4WD (good truck).   Last full size truck was Dodge Ram 1500 standard cab 2WD 5.7 hemi (great acceleration).   Typical commute to ranch is 220 miles but last 8 miles are rocky road and last 3/4 mile is Jeep trail.

2016,18-04-2016,2,0,4,Mileage from west end of Glacier National Park to east end and return was 23.73!   Mileage from Las Vegas Valley to Waterton Lakes National Park Alberta Canada and back was 20.56 which included substantial 80 MPH speed limits.   Around town mileage is rated 15 MPG and that is what we get if only town (not typical).   Combined is about 17.5 MPG.   ,
2016,15-07-2016,3,0.2714,5,Low RPM torque is excellent.   Pulls grades on I40 east of Kingman AZ mainly in 5th gear at 75 MPH.   ,
2016,25-03-2016,1,0.3818,5, Having owned many Rangers (which were very strong tough trucks) the Nissan Frontier is by far the better truck. Very strong frame very solid riding. The engine V-6  strong plenty of torque. The price advantage is excellent. A similar equipped Toyota Tacoma will list for apron $4.000 more.,
2016,07-08-2016,3,0.9612,5," Several packages over and above Std Crew Cab with 5 foot bed. Head restraints on back seats block 2/3rds of rearview mirror.  I removed the head restraints to have full view of rear of truck.  GPS/Navigation comes as a premium.  You can have GPS with custom mount for a lot less money and viewing the GPS is just off your right side of the steering wheel  at the 2 o'clock position.  I have used my TomTom 5/7"" on the last 4 Nissan Frontier Trucks with the same custom mount to the dashboard through the top vent of the left A/C vent.  The custom mount goes with me on each sale.  V6 Engine provides plenty of power when needed on the highway or on a city street.  I purchased separately a custom bed cover which enhances the gas mileage about 3% and completes the trim of the back of the truck.  Also keeps the storage area dry.  The bed extender attached to the inside of the bed with side & floor tracks with cleats has always been a must for the truck bed.  I am 6'4"" the Frontier offers plenty of leg room and head room.  So look over the various features and comfort packages to get what you need.",
2016,25-05-2016,2,0.1027,4, I bought this truck because I wanted a 4x4 midsize truck that would fit in my garage without paying 35+ thousand dollars. It is a nice reliable truck that is fairly comfortable in the front and I like the heated cloth seats. I drove 1000 miles straight thru and had no problems. However the back seats are terrible and I would feel sorry for anyone who has to ride in the back. Luckily I am generally the only one in it so for me it isn't a problem. The infotainment system is ok but not great. I have trouble with the primary apps (Pandora and Iheart Radio) dropping off occasionally and the speakers aren't great. It has dual climate control which I love. I also like the value package that came with the truck that allows for tying down cargo in the bed along with the bed extender. My biggest and loudest complaint is the awful terrible gas mileage. The truck has plenty of power which is nice but it is at the expense of gas mileage. There are full-size trucks out there that get way better fuel economy. In all it is a nice reliable truck. I like it and would recommend it but just understand what your getting. I am leasing this for another 1 1/2 yrs and will probably let it go primarily because of the gas mileage. However if they can improve on the fuel economy before my lease is up then I would have no problem getting another one because it is a nice truck otherwise.,
2016,04-05-2016,2,0.9784,5," Traded my 2009 dodge ram in for the 2016 Nissan frontier pro4x. I AM LOVE ! I have been looking for a new vehicle because my dodge literally was crumbling in front of me. Thought about going for the new Tacoma but I didn't like that it was the first run of the "" completely renewed Tacoma "" so I went for the frontier. The thought of it not being changed since 2004 really grabbed my attention as they hold their value so well. I owned a 2006 jeep wrangler before my dodge and I would say the frontier drives super similar to how the older jeeps drove which is why I fell in love with the pro4x. If you want a solid riding reliable truck then I say go for the frontier.",
2016,18-05-2016,2,0.9713,5, So far I love this truck.  I have only had it a month and I love the way it drives and handles the road.  If I had to give a negative the navigation system is a little bit lacking and subpar to say a store bought dash GPS.Other than that Great Truck!!!,
