1991,11-03-2002,1,0.2732,3.875, this is an update to the 91 taurus. my daughter has driven the car for 11000 miles in ten months.  it still starts up with no problems.  on weekend in feb 2017 she parked the taurus over night in seal beach ca.  someone had placed a note on the windshield noting if i ever want to sell the car to contact him a prospect buyer.  the 91 taurus  is well kept with a mirror like paint finish and does attract attention for the classic car enthusiasts.  the taurus is about the same size as a 2017 nissan sentra.  with the exception of the 700 lb weight difference on the 91 taurus which by the way is garaged most of the time.,,,,

1991,20-03-2004,1,0,3.875, It seems like everything that could have gone wrong on this car did. I replaced the oil pump the first week I owned the car.

1991,28-05-2003,2,0,1.5, This engine is the worse vehicle on the road.  Right now it is setting in the yard with a blowed head.  Or cracked block or both.  I do not recommend this for a used vehicle and of course ford did nothing about it.  The A/C and brakes are not any good.  I replaced brakes every 6 months.  And the a/c once it stopped working never worked correctly again.,,,,
1991,25-06-2005,2,-0.8864,4.5, Bought it at 99000 miles.  Since then I've put 81000 miles on it over 6 years.  While some of my friends have spent over $50000 to get new vehicles two or three times over the past six years and dealt with major mechanical problems on these new vehicles I've only had to replace the water pump and pay for regular maintenance on the Taurus that cost only a fraction of their vehicles.,,,,

1991,20-11-2003,4,0,5, My brother bought his Ford Taurus SHO brand new in 1991.Since my brother is serving in the military between the Iraq war and his new duty station in Japan force him to give the SHO  keys to me.Our experience with this car is the best ever not toyota or honda can come close to it.Regular maintance was most of the expenses.Right now our SHO has 160000 miles and feels like new.At 140000 new clutchwater pumpbrakesfuel pumphigh performance exaust alternator timing belt tires paint job tuned up front bearings and oil changes. All this maintenance is regular for any type of car including imports. My final words excellent car built tough to last until 300000 or more.,,,,

1991,11-10-2006,4,0,2.125, This car is basically a money pit. I'd be better off financially by throwing my wages into the fireplace.  Everything on this car has broken. The transmission is appalling.

1992,23-12-2003,4,0.5935,4.5, I got a great deal on mine since my brother is a car salesman. I paid $1000 for it with only 63000 miles on it! Although the a/c never worked I love this car. Built like a tank. The only problems I experienced were an radiator leak electrical issues and a hole in the exhaust (regular wear). I had mechanic friends so repairs were cheap for me. I recently fell victim to 2 accidents in 2 months. Both times I was hit by senior men who shouldn't be driving. My car now has significant cosmetic damage and will cost more than it's worth to fix so I'm trading it in for a '94 Taurus GL sedan ::tear tear:: I would buy it again if given the opportunity!,,,,

1992,07-11-2007,4,0.4019,2.375, got the car from my grandmother and had it for a year and took it to a auto shop they told me i needed inner and outer tie-rod ends cv boots a wheel bearing and struts...the struts were the only thing that shouldve been replaced at that time they said. the tranny felt like it would drop every time i shifted too. also had horrible gas mileage but no reasonable explanation,,,,
1992,25-10-2011,4,-0.5927,1, Car was overall a decient car for $100.00 however the subframe rusted out at the rear passenger side mount and the subframe dropped out luckly just after exiting the interstate. No I'm not embelishing this story it's all true!! After finding out there was a safety recall on this car from ford and the National Highway Safety Association. I contacted Ford and was told they would NOTY do anything to help me because of the age of the vehicle. I was also told not to contact them again. i know i only paid $100.00 for the car but I put plenty more into it which I was not able to recover via driving it. The car went to salvage with all the new parts i installed which i got $50.00 after towing.,,,,

1993,17-03-2002,1,0.5563,3.625, It's a pretty nice car.  Semi-sporty... plenty of power and fun to drive.  This car takes to Interstate roads like it enjoys them.  Very comfortable.  Very safe.  Unfortunately they also tend to have a variety of mechanical problems.  You can expect to be in and out of the garage every few months with a $100-200 repair bill.  But if you don't mind having to get them fixed up a few times a year they are nice cars.,,,,

1993,16-04-2016,2,0,2, It's a good looking body design cheap on the used market and the steering is responsive with a good radius but the transmission can be abrupt when driven aggressively. My only real frustration is the rear brake drums becoming warped too early (replaced a couple of times). The 3.0l v6 will not out pace many newer 4cyl cars and the fuel milage is consistently 20 mpg city or highway despite tune up fuel/ air filter replacement. It has been pretty reliable except the starter and issues with rear drums. I picked it up cheap and in pristine condition yet I'm looking for another car. There are plenty of cars that match or even get better fuel mileage and perform better. It would make a great spare car.,,,,

2000,01-04-2013,2,0,5, Very reliable! I have had my Ford Focus for 12 years and have never had any major problems Awesome gas milage at 32 mpg. I am six foot and it is a very confortable for me. My kids who are 5 ft. 5in. and 5ft. 6in. sat in the back seat for three hours driving to detriot with no complants. Has 200000 miles on it and it still runs good. For its age it is still very stylish. Takes my wife to work 30 miles a day and only have to fill up the gas tank once a week. I would strongly recommend this car. Just gave it away for a 2008 for a newer 2008 Focus,,,,
2000,23-06-2013,2,0.7901,4.25, My focus has been going strong for 184k miles which probably isn't the norm. It idles rough from an unbalanced engine. The power locks and a/c don't work. The headlights are easily scratched and get really dim. The hatch doesn't hold open in the cold. I've had to replace the ignition ($300) struts ($400) ball joints ($500) and vacuum hose ($80) in the 60k miles I have owned it.,,,,
2000,18-05-2014,2,0.6908,3.625,If you find a well maintained  2000-2004 SW with a ztec engine  it should be a fine car to own and drive.,,,,

2000,02-07-2005,3,0.3322,4," I bought the car with 60000 miles on it. I have got to admit now that I was down in the dumps when I bought that Ford nightmare. The next day as I was driving to work the Ford nightmare had a fuel pump problem and then the timing belt literally exploded and then oil leak and then fuel leak and then the AC broke down and then the water pump broke down and then the back power windows broke down and the car stereo broke down -- I had to hit it hard with my fist for it to function several times and then the Ford nightmare is a noise box and then and then and then. How many times did I say ""and then"" -  I have lost count.  Mayday Mayday Mayday DO NOT EVER BUY a FORD EVER Please...",,,,
2000,07-08-2005,3,-0.9652,1.875, I purchased my Focus in 2001 with 33000 miles and had no problems for the first 6 months; from then on it's been down hill. Recall on the rear wheel bearings recall on the battery cable that also blew my alternator and battery all 4 power window mechanisms have broken ($500) the brake job cost $500 because you have to get new rotors EVERY TIME -- they can't be machined the cooling system needed extensive repair ($2000-$3000) the electrical control for the air conditioner broke ($379) the CD player broke haven't gotten that repaired yet the ignition cylinder locked closed so I couldn't put the key in -- $1000 plus tow and the trunk lock broke ($700). To make it short over $7000 in repairs thus far.,,,,

2000,24-08-2008,3,0,4.625,More importantly other than routine maintainance the car has only had mechanical problems 3 times in all those years and miles (a broken fan belt and two failed alternators). That's it!,,,,

2000,06-10-2010,4,-0.25,3.125, This car was just totaled and that's the best thing that ever happened to us.  We have spent so much money on it: engine lock cylinder window motors etc etc.  There really is not much good that I can say about it.  I looked it up on the Ford website and it was the second worst Ford ever made and the worst Focus ever made.  It had over 100 recalls!  Stay away from this car!,,,,
2000,14-12-2011,4,-0.79,3.875, I got the car about two years ago from my aunt who is possibly the worst car owner on the planet. The car was broken down barely running dirty everything was broken. I got my hands on it and about 1300 dollars later it was running good. The best part about this car is how fun it is to drive. I can take off faster than half of the cars my friends have. The car feels alive you can feel it. I just wish it was a little bit better quality. The interior is nice but cheap. You can tell. The outside is styled well but it's also made with some cheap-looking parts. It also feels like it won't be running so good in a few years. Who knows it might last me forever.,,,,

2000,03-10-2015,4,-0.7269,5, The ztec is a great little engine.  my car has 162000 miles (260000km).  originally paid $16280USD ttl included.  i've been through two sets of all weather tires and two sets of winter tires (pass driving is much easier with snow tires).  I've replace the brakes twice one set of struts timing belt replaced (yes it is a necessary maintenance item at about 100K.  two sets of spark plugs an EGR valve and an O2 sensor and tie rod ends thanks to the crappy seattle roads. Oil changes every 5000 miles and transmission oil changed  every 30K miles.  I just replace the batter for the second time in 15 years.

2006,29-02-2016,1,0,5, Bought the SE V6 in new. The v6 runs great and still does for me but I also do regular maintenance myself and change the oil every 3k on the dot. Keeping 34psi in all tires is so important for gas mileage as well. These cars can't and aren't made to be dogged and that is why people have rough shifting.

They do not acknowledge the fact that this car should be considered a lemon. It has a foul smell coming from the ac/heater the brakes grind and pulsate when you apply pressure the interior has a constant rattling sound the front console latch broke off within one month of buying it the cheap plastic air vent covers fell off within 6 months of buying the vehicle and the transmission grinds jerks pops and seizes up often.

We purchased this car new in NOV 08. Within 6mnthswe had to take the car in to have the ""sync"" systems wiring harness replaced 4 times and the touch screen once! Within 16k miles (2 years) we had to replace the front rotors and brakes. And now just 11 months and 10k miles later we now need to replace the front rotors again the rear brakes and the rear rotors!

Especally love the Sirius Satellite Radio. I can't go anywhere without listening to it. My mom and dad helped me buy it. It was a birthday gift. My dad was dead set against it. He kept bugging and nagging about how about a Hyundai Chevy Toyota ANYTHING BUT A FORD was his very words. Finally made him come out of his stubborn shell. We went to the dealership where it was we took a test drive and he never complained about it ever.

We tell everyone how much we ""love"" our Flex and recommend it as a great car to purchase.  I can't wait for Ford to offer another 0% financing on the Flex so I can purchase a new one to enjoy.

Still gets great gas mileage. I average 34 mpg around town and 38 on the road. I've taken it all over the United states and keep up maintenance. The most I've done is replace gasket seals.,,,,
2009,26-12-2015,4,0.9001,4, This is a great car for a first time driver or small family. I'm 20 years old and I needed to upgrade really bad. I was driving a 1993 cavalier. I didn't have a lot of money to spend and I wanted t dependable car. So after looking and looking I found a 2009 1 owner focus with 46k miles. This was just 9 months ago. I've already drove 16k miles! This is a great car. I do have the base model but that helped with the price.,,,,
2009,27-12-2015,4,0.458,4, Overall this is a great car! My ford focus is currently at 171000 miles and is still going strong. The only things we've had to replace so far is the tires battery spark plugs etc. Comfort is great in the front seats however if you have multiple people in your family or have a carpool you should know the back seat is VERY tight.. still comfortable just not designed for anyone tall.. The other complaint would be the fact that they offered lighter colors in the focus. I believe most all cars should either have black interior or VERY dark gray.. We got an awesome deal on the car because of how stained and gross the inside is.. floorboard carpet and cloth seating looks terrible.. even after I've used several stain removers..,,,,

It's pretty good on fuel (when you don't put your foot in it which is almost never) it's an extremely comfortable and versatile car and did I mention it has ecoboost? I'm not a huge fan of the marketing speak Ford used to describe this twin turbo direct injection engine but this motor deserves every positive word said about it. I've done some light duty towing and the motor feels as though it is never straining. Passing power is where the powerplant shines. My only minor nits to pick would be a couple of trim pieces which have broken and a faulty O2 sensor which were both under warranty. ,,,,

I've driven this vehicle in all weather conditions and at all times of day.  While I am overall impressed with the vehicle however it does have a glaring safety concern.  The standard side view mirrors are inadequate for the vehicle. It desperately needs the full sized mirrors found on larger vans.

2010,24-07-2010,3,-0.4201,4.125, We use our transit connect for work. My number 1 concern is the lack of leg room for back seat passengers.

It's amazing what it swallows. I just finished hauling 27 fully loaded 18 gallon totes in one load. I'm sure I was pushing the hauling weight capacity but it worked perfectly. When it's empty it rides like a washboard but it hauls cargo with the best. I've had zero mechanical problems and the divers side is comfortable for a full day's work.

The cap-less design is easily damaged and then you can't get fuel in your vehicle it keeps shutting the pump off. I live in NJ where you can't pump your own gas so I cant control how they do it. Taking to dealer tomorrow to get it fixed but did some research and saw lots of comments on the web on this (not covered under warranty etc. and it seems to be way too common). So be wary!,,,,

It glides real smooth when driving it has great handling and turning radius. Not hard to park. The eco boost is awesome. It gets up and goes when you hit the peddle. Great for long hauls and short hauls. Highway and back roads with all the curves. I have over 3000 miles on it and can't complain.

He gets to work in all EV mode and regens a couple miles and a few miles back toward home before entering hybrid mode. If he could plug in at work we would rarely ever have to get gas.

2014,30-11-2016,4,0.7712,5, If you want a car that will last don't buy this one.  I had to replace what I thought was a head light bulb but turned into an headlight assembly burned out and cost well over $600.00.  I had to replace my battery-not the hybrid over 200.00.  I purchased an extend warranty but that didn't cover it burned out headlight assembly that actually showed it burned which might have been a problem if it caught fire.  I leased it and later decided to purchase it boy was I upside down.  I use it to commute for the carpool stickers and it doesn't hold it's value much so if you only drive around town good but get any mileage over 15000 a year this is not the car for you get a Toyota Prius it will last and also hold value I have one of these too.

My two complaints are sometimes the hands-free tailgate function doesn't work all the time and the navigation system is not as good as my iPhone.

2015,18-02-2017,1,-0.6808,5, Have had the C-Max for 18 months now.  Its been a great ride very fun quick and feels great to drive.  A very good job from ford everything feels great and such a good job of automating the car where lights wipers and everything is automatic.  The car is very well executed although CVT it feels right and  has good acceleration.   Power and handling both are good up to 90 MPH and above that this is not so fun making it better suited for  City and traffic particularly great electric only ride in heavy traffic with out turning on  the engine at all  up  to 85 MPH.  Being in LA have just done 20000 miles and looking forward to many more.  This is no prius the higher seating weight and drive feel more like a cross between a mini minivan and a hot hatchback (which is very heavy at almost 4000 pounds).   My best tank MPG was about 85 MPG almost 1100 miles a 12 gallon tank and least has been around 65 MPG.   I am due for a second oil change shortly making it 10000 interval for maintenance which is always a good bonus.  Not much I would fault the car for maybe a bit higher ride and ground clearance be good but I do like the ride.  I got the plug in but the hybrid only ones were more fun much lighter and sharper rides.   I do have passengers often and the back  seat is very comfortable.  Ford has a winning formula for the car of the future size power and the whole package.,,,,
2015,06-09-2015,3,0.9933,4, Original review from 2015: I was in the market for a plug in hybrid vehicle so choices were limited to the Prius the Volt and the C-Max.  I test drove all 3 and my favorite was the C-Max.  I chose it over the Prius because it was more fun to drive and had more built-in technology such as the navigation entertainment center bluetooth voice commands park assist hands-free tailgate opening.  The Volt had better acceleration  was low to the ground and had a sports car feel.  Being a family guy I opted for the C-Max which had a SUV-like look and feel (it is higher off the ground and had better visibility of the road).  It is my first Ford car and it is fun to drive.  I have been averaging 70mpg on a 50 mile commute to work. I work in Los Angeles and have found many places that supply the 220v outlets so I plug in while at work.,,,,
2015,14-07-2016,3,0.9503,4, The energi version is the one we bought as the higher price was offset by the government tax rebate - thus the upgrade was free.  However this is our run-around-town car so the limited trunk space wasn't a problem.  If space is essential stay with the hybrid version.  Our car will go about 18-20 miles on the battery only just depends on the time of year.,,,,
2015,12-08-2016,3,0.5235,5, I have owned over 35 vehicles in my life. Cars trucks and everything in between including a Nissan Leaf. This is without a doubt the best vehicle I have had so far. Great interior and comfort. Great stereo system. Room for 4 tall adults easily. Fantastic visibility. Great power and handling. Fantastic gas mileage. I average between 58mpg and 65mpg on my daily drive to work and back. My only complaint is the huge battery takes up most of the cargo area and for the price of this vehicle it should have a backup camera included but it does have backup sensors. This is a fantastic vehicle and I do not understand why Ford does no advertising on it. I hope they are not going to phase it out because that would be a huge mistake.,,,,
2015,24-09-2016,3,0.9519,5," I've been scratching my head for the last year (that's how long I've owned my C-Max Energi) as to why Ford doesn't market this car (the regular Hybrid and the plug-in) against the hot-segment ""subcompact SUV's"" where it is essentially the same size (though different styling) and is cost-competitive (with the continuous incentives) while being so much better in so many ways - quieter much better passing/merging power much better mileage higher-quality interior better visibility etc...My spouse has the Subaru XV Crosstrek one of the more popular subcompact SUV's and while it's a nice car that we like my C-Max Energi is better in almost every respect even though I paid thousands less (after tax credit and incentives) than my spouse paid. Other than the lack of all-wheel drive (which I don't care about) and the XV Crosstrek's higher ground clearance the Subaru has essentially no advantages even though it costs more. By the way the exterior dimensions of the two cars are within about an inch or so on length/width/height and my perception is that the C-Max has a higher ride-height for the driver than the Crosstrek though that may just be my perception.",,,,
2015,25-11-2015,4,0.9745,3,Pros :  Roomy interior with a good ambience,,,,
2015,19-12-2015,4,0.4404,5,I think only marketing the car as a Prius alternative (when they market it at all) has severely hurt the C-Max sales since the C-Max will clearly not win purely on MPG; but it is such a better car in every other way that it's a shame they don't do more to broaden the appeal/category. Even letting it be pegged as a hatch-back/wagon hurts it since it really could fit into a few different categories (my view).,,,,
2016,05-02-2016,1,-0.6332,5," This is not your father's daily driver. I was looking for a replacement hatchback for my beloved 2002 Honda Si (251000mi). I had recently rented a 2015 Focus sedan and was surprisingly impressed by it's ""big car"" characteristics. I have never owned a Ford automobile. Since Honda didn't have a replacement Si available I went to test drive a basic 5spd Focus hatchback. Looking around the lot I was impressed from the window view of the ST interior. I had not researched that car and didn't know what I was in for after asking for a test drive. Not surprisingly the salesman offered no resistance...",,,,
2016,06-02-2016,1,0.8934,5,"The Focus ST is a niche car.  It is aimed (noticed how I didn't say focused  ;-)   ) at someone who wants a fun and exciting car that is also practical and affordable.  I don't believe everything I read especially in advertising but this car delivers.  I am surprised at how well it delivers.  The acceleration is quick the steering is quick and the braking is quick.  There are 5 other cars and a pickup in my driveway but there is only one car you would chose if you said to yourself ""I just feel like going out for a drive"".   There is great power delivery even down low and when the turbo kicks in you feel it push you back in the seat.  Gearbox is smooth.  You can row back and forth through the six gears if you want but the powerband is broad enough that downshifts are not nearly as necessary as some manuals I have owned.  The tires and suspension let you feel all the road imperfections but it is not harsh and handling always feels connected instead of busy or mushy.  Torque steer?  It is there if you push it in first or second.  Not hard to control but can be surprising when the car decides it doesn't want to accelerate in a straight line like you expected.  Overall the car is reasonably quiet.  You do hear the  engine 'power symposer' when you accelerate but not even loud enough to drown out a normal conversation.  I have yet to hear the turbo whistle at all.  Didn't get the Recaro seats.  The base seats fit me much better.  My ST1 has the base Ford Sync so I can't comment on Sync 3 either.   Although this is my daily driver in no way is it just an average commuter car.  It is for people who enjoy cars and want something that involves them in driving.  Choosing an ST is a personal statement. I think it is a mistake by Ford to offer it only in the ST1/2/3 packages.  I would have liked to pick and chose exactly which options fit me.  A marketing decision I am sure.   ",,,,
2016,05-04-2016,2,0.9871,4,I don't challenge Mustangs Camaros and Chargers at the stop lights.  I don't wait to ambush BMW's and Vettes on twisty roads.  I don't look for 2 miles of straight road where I can wind it out (but I do admit on ramps have become lots of fun all of a sudden).  There are bigger cars and faster cars and smoother cars and easier cars to drive.  My ST is an every day driver that puts a smile on my face.  It knew it was what I wanted as soon as I drove it.,,,,
2016,17-06-2016,2,0.835,5, This is my second Flex I traded in my 2009 for a 2016. It is the best family mover. My husband's Ford Explorer doesn't have nearly the space or flexibility as my Flex. I can haul 6 kids and all their stuff. The cargo area is deep so you have a lot more space than some other cars. It has great leg and head room even in the third row. The third row sits up like stadium seating so it is less claustrophobic. My SEL has a 120V plug and well as many charger locations which is definitely needed. The sync system works very well. I looked at Toyota Nissan Honda GMC Buick Hyundai but the Flex was definitely the best.,,,,
2016,29-06-2016,2,0.9633,1, I have always loved Ford. We have owned an Expedition 2 different F150 F250 and now the Brand new 2016 Flex. I will never again buy a Ford. I have been broken down 5 times in the first 6000 miles. The car suddenly losses the ability to accelerate very unsafe. First time it happened I tried restarting the car but it didn't help. I had ford roadside tow the car to the nearest dealer. I was told by that dealer they see it has a code the throttle body was the problem. But when they test drove the next day it accelerated fine. Which ment they wouldn't be allowed to fix it by Ford motor company unless it continues to happen. I called the dealer we bought it from. They were very kind and said they would order the new throttle body and to keep driving the car. I was told it would be best for the warranty if it continues to happen. Well today my car broke down 4 times!! After the 3rd power loss I tried to have it towed to the dealer that already had a part on order. However I was told it had to go to the nearest Ford. I was so upset I hung up and decided to try to make it home to have my husband follow me to the dealer we were already working with. I was driving past the nearest ford on my way home. So I stopped and explained the problem and that I felt unsafe driving. I was told they couldn't take the car for repair if another dealer already ordered parts they also said they were not able to help me get it to the other dealer maybe 20 min away. I was told to drive it on back roads and that it shouldn't keep happening. Well I tried but when it broke down during rush hour for the fourth time only a few miles down the road. I had the car towed to the dealer that had ordered the parts. No new car with 6000 miles should break down 5 times! No car company should the car must to go to the nearest dealer and when it gets there refuse service. Parts are back ordered for weeks but I won't be driving that car. It is an accident waiting to happen. Shame on Ford!! It also has problems with the suspension it will be getting looked at for that for a third time! They can hear the problem with the suspension but can't find it. I hate my flex. Worst car I have ever owned. Horrible service from manufacturer. We had isseus with past cars but Ford was always amazing and took care of any problems. Not sure what has happened to ford but I won't be buying another ford. And I hope their lemon doesn't cause my family to get in an accident! Buyer be ware!!!,,,,
2016,03-06-2017,2,-0.988,5, I have had numerous vehicles (i.e.: Chrysler Dodge Jeep & Honda's).  I have been dreaming about getting a Ford Flex because I love the size and when I first drove a vehicle at age 18 I took my drivers test with a 1975 Chevy Impala Wagon and passed the test with 100%.  I love the larger vehicles because I feel safe in them and with my 2016 Ford Flex Limited I love the ride and it so far hasn't had any problems.  When I bought the vehicle as being used with close to 18000 miles in it I looked into the VIN," to see if there were any ""Recalls"" in it after I had bought it and yes it had maybe 1 and that was the Throttle issue so I took it in to the Ford Dealership but I bought the vehicle at a Chrysler Dealership within the same city but it was still in it's ""3 Year/36000 Mile"" warranty and FORD took care of the issue and it only took about 1.5 hours to fix and replace with a new one.  So I was told by the FORD dealership that they are suppose to take care of the vehicle no matter where you buy it previously if ""USED"" and they are responsible within the ""3 Years/36000 Miles"" warranty but if you bought the extended warranty then the dealership where you bought it at for the extended warranty they are then responsible for the issues that needs to be fixed after the ""Original"" warranty is over.  But I went to the state of Virginia for a visit this 2017 for 2 months and I drove there with my husband and 2 dogs and our luggage and then some and the car didn't at all have any problems after I had the ""Throttle Recall"" fixed and replaced.  I made sure that the recalls were all fixed and replace even before I went on our trip.  When I bought the vehicle days after I went back to the dealership where I bought it at and they told me as well that Ford would take care of the recalls and issues within the first 3Years/36000Miles original warranty and when that's over since I bought the extended warranty from a Chrysler dealership that they would then take over with repairs and issues with the vehicle.  But I had the Ford Dealership put ""Full Synthetic Oil"" in my vehicle because first the engine oil lasts longer instead of going every 3000 miles to get it replaced I can actually go every 6000-8000 miles every time.  I also use 89 as my gasoline in my vehicle so it performs better without the extra additives the 87 gasoline receives.  So I made sure before I left for my long haul across the United States that my vehicle is ""Sound"" and ""Without Issues"" during my drive.  I have been back since and I am still loving my 2016 Ford Flex Limited in the Magnetic color.  For everybody when you buy a vehicle whether it's New or Used you should check the VIN", for recalls after you have bought it so that it doesn't have any problems in the long run.  I felt bad for the person who left the review that her Ford Flex wasn't new anymore after 6000 miles.  If her and her husband did their due diligence regarding the VIN, and Recalls then they wouldn't have this issue.  For all of the vehicles I've had in the past I always look into the VIN, and reviews from other people from other websites and if the vehicle isn't as good then I wouldn't buy it.  Again I have been dreaming about buying a Ford Flex since it first came out and now I have one and am loving every moment and drive with it.  Although I wish there was a used Ford Flex with the EcoBoost engine in it because I love the speed and my vehicle only has the regular V6 but I still do love it.  Hope this review helps with future customers and with the FORD FLEX.
2016,24-06-2017,2,0.9506,5, This is the first Ford car I have ever owned.  I bought the 2016 Flex Unlimited.  It has the feel of a luxury car. And the size is great for anyone with kids.  Now my husband is also buying a Ford Flex Unlimited I so happy we will be a two Flex family.,,,,
2016,02-07-2016,3,0.8702,5,"I bought it the first time I shifted into 3rd gear carrying some revs. I won't soon forget the experience of that turbo propelled acceleration. The overwhelming harmony of the power steering and symphony of engine and exhaust notes was instantly addictive. It was the Si I had always dreamed of and much much more. The fit and finish of the interior is excellent very easy on the eyes and full of discovery. I'm 6'1"" 210lbs and find the seats fit like a glove. They are comfortable and meaningful when you accelerate into a curve and pleasant while waiting for the green.",,,,
2016,09-07-2016,3,0.9751,2," This review is based on renting the car for 5 days.   They took a decent comfortable sedan and tried to stuff it full of annoying electronic features that do annoying things at inexplicable times.   It was always beeping and shrieking for no apparent reason.   Never did figure it out.  The displays are confusing and too bright.  The ""keyless"" key was equally annoying.  You didn't have to put it into a switch so you toss it somewhere but you still have to dig it out to lock the car which winds up being as much or more trouble.   It did move along comfortably as one would expect of an American big car [big by today's standards anyway.]  The trunk was nice and roomy.  The seats seemed to be leather so maybe it was an SEL I don't know.  The cabin temperature was always too hot or too cold and someone thought it was a good idea for any change to the settings to take place over 5-10 seconds to confuse people further.  Would not own this car.",,,,
2016,29-08-2016,3,0.5284,5, I know I know it's not the coolest kid on the block but don't under estimate the Flex. It is a very nice ride. It handles like a dream and it is super comfortable! If you're not sure what you want definitely give the Flex a try.,,,,

2017,23-01-2017,1,-0.296,5, I test drove the Chevy Camaro Dodge Challenger and Nissan 370Z.  All the listed had advantages and disadvantages. Also read several magazine articles/reviews which favored the Mustang as a daily driver and then took the Mustang for a few more test drives and for me the Ford Mustang 5.0 GT Premium black on black with blacked out emblems and automatic transmission won hands down.  All around a more driver friendly car but definitely still plenty of muscle for the road to include back roads.  Felt more comfortable for the longer drives and the fit and finish to include a nicely appointed interior definitely sold me to the Ford.  I don't consider myself a Ford guy but after driving the Mustang I decided I had to own one.  To date I've driven it to the NYC area and it was very comfortable for three hours each way and very soon to Daytona to attend the Rolex 24.  I've only owned it since late December 2016 so there are a number of areas on this survey I can't yet speak to...but I'm definitely hoping they are just as strong in the positive as my experience so far.,,,,

This car has really matured since my old '86 gt I had years ago. The car is larger and drives larger than both my '86 and my '02 GT I had to sell before buying this Mustang yet it far out handles both of them (my 02 GT had about 4k in aftermarket upgrades in both engine mods and suspension).  The only real complaint about the car is the ingress and egress for me. I am 6'4"" and you have to be fairly flexible to get in and out. Once you are in though the car fits like a glove the shifter falling right into place the steering wheel can be adjusted to taste and everything is very simple to use. The standard leather seats are outstanding and after taking a 6-1/2 hour trip up to Napa from So. Cal the seats gave my wife and I plenty of support and the heating and cooling feature is great! As for the performance...my mustang is plenty quick but I don't drive it to be a drag racer. I wanted a true GT. The handling is more than adequate with the performance package and the six piston Brembos are superlative. There is a reason why Mustangs have been around for over 50 years. Ford has obviously found a formula of performance comfort and style and blend it together in a fashion that other American car manufacturers try to emulate but always come up short in one or more of these categories missing the mark on Ford's pony car and what it represents.",,,,
2017,13-03-2017,1,0.9336,5, Handles and drives like a much lighter and smaller car.  Is the first car I have owned where the factory left me nothing to do aftermarket.  As pleased as I have ever been with a car purchase.  Dispite the highish price it is great value for what you get.  It would cost more to mod a mustang GT (also a very good platform) to get it to the level of ths car as a stock package.,,,,
2017,22-03-2017,1,0.9511,2,Original review starts here:  I loved my 2014 Mustang convertible (read the review) so I got a new 2017 to have all of the active safety features and other convenience tech. What I got was something that is a huge step up in quality.  In fact a different machine with the feel of the BMWs (Mustang handles better in my opinion - test them) I tested and a huge leap above a Camaro.  It accelerates smoothly up to 121 mph (where it is electronically limited) gets up to 32 mpg on highway (with super unleaded about 29-30 with regular).  Handles much better than the GT (again try them out side by side - I did several times - GT feels front heavy and bulky). Drives like a sports car. Has plenty of storage something lacking in the old Mustang and non-existent in Camaros.  The only things lacking is automatic braking (something I will demand in 3 years or I will switch models) and lane warning/assist.  The forward collision warning is great but it just pre-loads brakes probably a nod to the general macho among Mustang owners but auto braking should be an option for those of us more concerned with being alive (and the safety of others) than imagined macho.  Another after market add on is a windscreen which really makes a difference.  It makes your car a two seater when in place but I never have more than one lady friend at a time riding! :)  Easy to remove but don't get this car for a backseat anyway.  One small feature I love is the center console which locks when you hit the door lock fob.  I leave the top down a lot when I go into a store. This combined with alarms keeps stray hands out that stuff.  All in all a wonderful car.  If they add automatic braking I will be getting another in about 3 years.,,,,
2017,29-03-2017,1,0.9934,5, Love the style comfort & smooth power & performance.,,,,
2017,02-04-2017,2,0.7717,5, My wife and I got this car as a loaner for our regular car's recall replacement. I've never owned a performance auto but have been a long time motorcyclist and have owned several high performance 2-wheelers. This Mustang blows me away. The acceleration is awesome. I drove across a mountain range on a very twisty section of interstate and have to say that was the most fun I have ever had on 4 wheels. It was solidly planted the steering was very precise; I could easily change lines mid-curve; acceleration out of the curves was very controlled. With the top up it feels like an upscale touring car. With the top down it is simply sexy as h***. We're now planning to sell our SUV and buy a new Mustang. Life is short.,,,,
2017,27-04-2017,2,0.9804,4, Check out your car very well before purchasing. It is obvious that Ford still does not care about quality after all of these years & why I avoided them for most of my life. The car I have is twisted. The driver's side door is warped. The hood is extremely hard to open because it barely opens far enough to get small fingers underneath to get to the release. The body lines do not line up. The dealership could do nothing about this and the repairs will require a body shop. I know this is a bad car that I bought but these things should have been caught by Ford before being released from the factory! It wasn't noticed by me until I got the car home & really went over it that evening. The dealer is doing it's best to get it fixed by getting it to the right people but it really should go back to Ford & I should get a replacement car. Other than the body/frame issues the car drives great handles great looks great and the front seats are comfortable. Can't say much for the back seat. The rear seats look great but are useless. A child couldn't even sit back there. St least the trunk is very roomy. I like the car but it will definitely be my last Ford.,,,,
2017,01-05-2017,2,0.99,5, Had a Vette C-7 which was a great car until I drove this beast! Slightly less money for more options I am very impressed so far.,,,,
2017,01-05-2017,2,0.831,5, I have not really enjoyed driving for years but now me and the wife race to see you GETS to drive ya its that much fun!,,,,
2017,06-05-2017,2,0.5835,5, Wanted to own Mustang forever practicality and utility always won and I ended up with either a 4 door sedan or an SUV.  Life's too short to live with regrets so I made a decision and found my 2015 50th Anniversary Mustang in Wimbeldon white. The sound of that V8 is music to my ears and never fails to put a smile on my face. She gets washed 3-4 times a week and ois always lookng her best. Best decision I ever made!  Now only if the gas mileage could improve I wouldn't find myself at the gas station so often.,,,,
2017,08-05-2017,2,0.956,5, Second C max love the savings!,,,,
2017,09-05-2017,2,0.6696,5," Since letting my 69 GTO go way back in 1983 I've missed having a little muscle under the hood. I've driven many cars since then mostly ""responsible"" types until my wife picked up a Porshe Boxter S a few years ago. The thrill of fast acceleration and road hugging turns on the local road track got me thinking about speed again but driving this car every day is a no way!  While fun it's just not a daily driver. I started considering trading in my latest Acura a few months ago or maybe just selling it outright and picking up an old late 60's or early 70's muscle car. After looking for a while I kept remembering that while my GTO was fun I worked on it as much as I drove it. Started looking at late model muscle cars Lexus Camero Corvette and then the Shelby GT350.  Everything about this car spoke quality and performance and driving it is just a true pleasure. I like it's interior far more than the other American competition and once you hear that Vodoo engine rev there's just nothing else like it! I do a lot of highway and while I miss my modern car lane assist this thing is so steady that you can take your hands off the wheel for at least as long as a car with lane assist in the straight sections of highway. Unlike what I'd of gained in an old muscle car lots of straight line power this thing also hugs the road like any European sports car. I had read about a few miner quality issues other buyers had experiences and I had the same lose pop in plastic rivets on some ground effects and a pin hole in on rear CV boot but the dealer made it all right in no time. I've never made an automobile purchase without some level of buyer's remorse until this one. I look forward to driving it every day and cannot wait to get her on both the drag strip and road course. I think it's only short coming might be off the line in the quarter mile where the relatively low torque of this engine and 3.73 gearing causes it to lug just a bit but it appears to makes up for it as soon as the R's get up past the 4000 mark and makes an impressive quarter mile in the 12 second range. Heck my GTO only did low 13's but it's low end torque would lift the front wheels off the ground and snap things left and right. I don't miss that! Of course she was slightly modified. Am I happy? Darn right I am. Thank you Ford and American ingenuity and thanks to the foreign competition that drove you to reinvent the muscle car!",,,,
2017,17-05-2017,2,0.9899,5, Just purchased the Mustang V6 auto last week.  Impressive car.  I have owned 11 mustangs in the past and this is by far the most capable mustang yet.  The V6 has plenty of power and the transmission shifts at just the right times.  The independent rear suspension is great and provides an aggressive yet comfortable ride.  Although I haven't put too many miles on the car yet averaging 24.5 mpg with a 60/40 mix of in-town and freeway driving.  This is great.   The interior is very good with soft materials where you want them and the seats are very supportive and comfortable.  Impressive implementation of the instrumentation.  I am sad that this is the last year for the V6 as it is a great engine and is a fantastic performer.  I found the 4cyl loud under load and at times clumsy on the test drive and I feel Ford is making a big mistake removing the V6 from the engine lineup.   Overall I have a big smile on my face and am enjoying the ride.  I am looking forward to putting the mustang through its paces on a trip this summer on route 66.,,,,
2017,20-05-2017,2,0.9899,5," My last 4 cars were Priuses my wife also drives a Prius.  her forst response when she drove my C-Max was ""WOW!""  I wanted a plug in but the Prius plug in wasn't available yet in my state so I took a look at the C-Max Energi.  SO GLAD I DID!  I LOVE THIS CAR!  It is better than the Prius in every possible way except possibly reliability which in the Prius is legendary the C-Max could be too just haven't had it long enough to know.  It is faster more quiet much more comfortable and the deal I got was unbelievable (especially when you include the $4500 refundable federal tax credit!).  I'm also getting more miles per charge than advertised as much as 28 miles.  You can charge it at home fully charges overnight with a regular outlet as best we can tell it cost about $20 per month in electricity and lucky for me I have fast chargers available to me for free at my work (fully charges in less than 3 hours).  I have a 54 mile round trip commute and only have to fill the tank about once every 3 to 4 weeks and am averaging 74 mpg so far.  i cannot recommend this car more highly!  Crazy thing is I never see any on the road?  Ford clearly isn't doing a good enough job marketing this car it blows the Prius away and I know what I'm talking about between my wife and me we've had seven never thought I'd by any other car.",,,,
2017,12-06-2017,2,0.9875,3," The steering wheel needs a major overhaul. It has n't changed in years with that big ugly middle. The tiny display screen needs to be upgraded so you can see it. 7"" minimum. too many buttons makes you drive off the road.",,,,
2017,21-06-2017,2,-0.5106,5, In energi model battery takes up about half of the small hatchback area but a cover over the battery gives a decent sized flat area for groceries so can still fit a full cart load. Larger items not so much. Rear seats fold down but battery makes hump in what would be a large flat space. This cargo arrangement works for me but really wouldn't work if I had full sized stroller or lots of gear.,,,,

2017,28-08-2016,3,0,5, Great car and great value.,,,,
2017,31-08-2016,3,0.891,5, I used the Edmunds.com price to buy the car through the ford dealership fleet sales manager. It could not have been easier. The car is one month old now and it's a fun car to drive... Just put the top down and go!   I got the new platinum white color which I love because it has a nice pearl finish.,,,,
2017,14-09-2016,3,0.8767,4," Yes They do! finally a mustang for modern America.  With the new suspension in the rear this car drives! Instead of the old mustangs where going into a corner meant ending up at the coroner's this mustang lets you power through in control. Fun to drive with a stiff but yet forgiving ride.  Can't wait to take this to the track both the drag and the road track. This does not however mean it's all roses for the new mustang.  The interior leaves you wanting and thinking why? For example there are very few fake aluminum-plastic lookalike pieces 5 switches 2 accents and the cowling around each primary air vents. With so few of these items why not use real aluminum? It would have increased the cost by 60 bucks so it leaves me saying why? Secondly the GT coyote engine suffers from a lack of tech. Ford makes the all amazing ford GT which has an engine that has the capability to turn off cylinders and has the red light ""stop start"" function these or at the very lest the ""stop start"" should be a must for this engine and would help massively with fuel eco.  That being said the noise the cayote engine makes and the power it produces is something that must be experienced to believe!",,,,
2017,16-09-2016,3,0.9343,5, I just received my 2017 Mustang GT Premium that was ordered back in March.  I ordered it with the performance package premium leather and the 6 speed manual transmission.  This is my first Mustang that I have ordered and I do have to say the wait was longer then I expected.  When the car finally came in the dealer was excellent in getting it ready for me to pick up.  The interior is very nice and well thought out - the only down side is there is not a whole lot of room in the back seats.  That is about the only negative I can say about the interior.  I ordered the premium leather with the red accents and they are very comfortable and look GREAT!  The 5.0 Coyote is one strong motor.  It has all the power and go that you will need.  Very strong and very quick.  When you step on it it wakes up and you will be through the gears before you know it.  Very impressed.  All I can say Ford did a wonderful job on this car.  This is a true American Muscle Car.  It is built from the ground up to be a Mustang and no other chassis in the Ford line up shares any parts of it.  Great Muscle Car!!,,,,
2017,26-09-2016,3,0.991,5, Make sure you fully understand the power of this new pony! The Shelby isn't just a regular GT Mustang- whole new world.  I went from a Nissan Z350 and knew right away that the GT350 was a beast that had to be tamed.  You can feel the power as soon as you turn the car on! Be safe- learn the car and have fun with that raw power.  Also did I mention that this pony corners as well as my old Z350 which I thought cornered very well! I was surprised since the mustang was never known to corner! They added independent rear wheel suspension! Only took them 50 years lol! So this pony can do it all now- drive to work and race on the track,,,,
2017,12-07-2017,3,0.9242,3, I loved my 2011 so much when my son took it off to college I bought myself a 2017. Sadly the 2017 seems like a step backwards. The gas mileage is worse the plastic exterior parts are cheap and fragile (simple freeway stone blew a hole in the front another piece was broke by a simple shopping cart bump) the interior has terrible design errors (i.e. the seat bracing connecting back to bottom grinds into you when you exit the car (broke the cell phone in my back pocket) the plastic and cloth features scuff at every light touch and they glued felt on the seat belt buckle to solve a clacking noise where it banged against the center console. I would have easily given my 2011 5-stars... I struggle to give the 2017 more than 3 but it does have great engine power looks amazing and will hopefully be as reliable in the end as my 2011. Ford see what you can do about actually improving the model (features/performance) from year to year.,,,,
2017,19-07-2017,3,0.9535,5, When I wentMustang shopping I was leaning toward a six cyl. But after driving the Eco boost I was SOLD on the 4 cyl.!  I am in my early 70's and at first thought I was too old and should buy a more old-fartish kind of car but after driving this hot little pony I made up my mind I was going to feed the kid in me!  My wife?  She loves it!!!,,,,
2017,18-10-2016,4,0.8429,5, Love the car inside and out. average fuel milage about 22 miles a gallon city driving. Excellent acceleration and handles real well. Sound system wonderful. Fun car shouldn't get bored of this car.,,,,
2017,28-10-2016,4,0.9572,5, My overall rating would have been higher had the V8 engine been available with a shutdown feature at highway speeds to increase overall mileage. The Corvette has it. I bought the car 9/7 and put 10K miles on it by 3/1. It came with the 265/35/20 tires and they really hold the road. Replacements will be in  the close to $300 each range but they have a 500 wear rating and roll out smooth. The pre-settings on the driver power seat allows for easy exit and entrance. The interior is well done and high quality. The car is surprisingly quiet with top up or down. I bought the Mustang because I need as much trunk space as possible for my trips and unlike the hardtop convertibles the Mustang top folds onto itself with no intrusion into an almost full size trunk. The top goes up and down quietly and fast. I downgraded the Navigation system because there is no way to alphabetize your Favorites or eliminate previous destinations individually. There is a myriad of options in the gauges and lighting features. The engine data that is displayed is far beyond the average driver. The car is a bargain in today's market. Options included automatic with paddle shifters Nav system tire pkg upgraded interior 120000 mile warranty.,,,,
2017,18-12-2016,4,0.9418,5, Update: I had to trade in this car on a new Honda CRV Touring.  I just could not get out of it any more. My joints were in rebellion so I am just too old (68) for this car with deep and low bucket seats.  In fact when I showed the CRV to my Aunt and Uncle they went and traded in their Lincoln Town Car on the exact same thing. My Aunt was able to get out with no effort at all with her bad knees. That is the ONLY problem I had with using the 2017 Mustang but it was enough.  It also depreciated heavily in 7 months from $42K to $24K KBB trade!  That part is disgusting but you get nothing for all the add-ons...beware!,,,,
