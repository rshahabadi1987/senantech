2012,08-02-2012,1,0,4.5,Some parts of the interior seem cheap - plastic bolt under glove box has popped out leaving the upholstery flapping gear shift ring broke etc. Outside the paint is peeling on the strip between the sunroof and front windshield. The worst issue is the clutch dying suddenly at 28000 miles (no slipping no burning clutch smell to warn you it just worked and then it didn't in my case in the middle of an intersection.) I've driven stick all my life and never run through a clutch that quickly. Peruse the forums and reviews for the 2012 FIAT 500 Manual Transmission and you'll see I'm not alone. No help from the dealership either.,
2012,01-03-2012,1,-0.8454,3.125, I bought my new 2012 Fiat 500 Pop on 12/22/2011.,
2012,05-03-2012,1,0,4," I also have had ""issues"" with my Fiat.",
2012,26-01-2015,1,0,3,Not explanable nor able to recreate.,
2012,12-03-2015,1,0,4,Right now I cant think of any.,
2012,13-01-2016,1,0,3,"Concerned with an event.. ""slipping into drive"" while idling.",
2012,24-01-2016,1,0,3,That day I noticed electrical problems and that the leak wasn't repaired. Returned it to the shop More open body seams were found around the windshield. I requested a replacement. Fiat agreed. The dealership acquired my replacement on 02/10/2012 but has yet to get it to me (03/01). My Fiat Case Manager is Kathy Nelson but I have no way to contact her. I regret my purchase.,
2012,30-04-2011,2,-0.8176,5, My first impression was to laugh at this car it was tiny and looked 'different'.,
2012,24-04-2013,2,0.6705,4,"Three days after purchase I noticed an interior water leak and returned the car to the dealer. The dealer found that the cause of the leaks were ""body seams that were left open unwelded and unpainted during manufacture.""",
2012,08-04-2015,2,-0.34,3.25, I want to love this car but one of the main reasons I bought it was for its affordability and I haven't even had it 2 years and I'm already paying 10% of the original cost in repairs! I bought it one year used with 11000 miles on it. It's now 28000 at miles and it's had problems with everything from cosmetic issues like peeling paint to an air bag sensor failure to a very serious no-warning clutch failure (which was not covered under warranty after 15000 miles). The clutch replacement at a FIAT dealer has taken 10 days so far and is costing a small fortune. It's a fun car but just not holding up! I always drove a Subaru or Toyota before and I think it may be time to go back. ,
2012,08-04-2015,2,-0.3661,2.75,Affordable (assuming you don't need repairs that aren't covered by the warranty) cute good gas mileage handles well given the small engine (struggles a little on hills) makes parking easy back seat folds down easily to carry a decent amount of cargo. ,
2012,14-04-2015,2,0.9062,2.5, Got the car back after 23 days in the shop.,
2012,07-07-2015,3,0,3.125,It's 101hp so your not going to win any drag races... but you can throw this car into any corner on ramp or off ramp almost at any speed and it will just go exactly where you point it!,
2012,04-08-2015,3,-0.4172,2, I was driving at a speed of 55 mph when without any warning my car shut off.  Thank God I or someone else was not hurt. My fiat is a 2012 with 53000 miles on it.  The only thing Ive had to do is replace both brake lights at the same time and a headlight. When the car died I could not get my key out of the ignition nor could I get the car out of gear.  It had totally locked up.  Just called the dealership and the car wont even communicated with the computer to find out whats wrong. Sounds expensive to me.  ,
2012,02-09-2015,3,0.1808,4,The 6-speed Italian made tip-tronic automatic is a brilliant transmission!,
2012,24-11-2015,4,0.6239,2,Will need to wait for 6-8 weeks for a part r/t the strut.,

2013,27-01-2013,1,0.6696,4.875,Each one a wonderful little car....as long as you loved sporting little Italian designed automobiles.,
2013,12-02-2013,1,0.8225,4.75,"The seats bother my lower back on longer trips.  I dropped the money for wet okole seat covers with lumbar support and now they are pretty good.  Given that getting leather seats was a waste and maybe the cloth would have been better on my back.  Blue and me interface is pretty low tech and user un-friendly but not a deal breaker.  Beats audio is better than stock but still not great.  If you get 17"" wheels with summer tires you will need dedicated snow tires if you ever touch snow/ice.  ",
2013,01-03-2013,1,0.7656,4.875,After having had my Fiat 500 for two months I feel that I know the car well and can comment on it.,
2013,09-01-2014,1,0.2732,5,Then when they tossed in the Abarth engineering along with a Turbo and strengthened trans equal length half-shafts etc.,
2013,16-01-2015,1,0.4215,4.25, Up front I'll say that I love this car and it is great for my needs.  But this is absolutely a niche vehicle that is lots of fun as a run-about but gives up a lot in utility/flexibility.  There is no way I would have bought this as an only car in the household--something like a GTI would make way more sense or a Focus ST if you wanted more edginess.  That said I felt the Abarth had way more character was more fun and was more unique for a hot hatch.  It feels a more raw and simple than the competition--which I like.  It gets me to work every day puts a smile on my face when I drive it gets good gas mileage and for short trips fits a family of three and groceries for a couple of days.,
2013,13-03-2015,1,0.9704,5,Was considering other small/light 'fun' cars such as the Mini/Mazda Mx5/BRZ-FRS but for similar performance/features it would be 10K more anyway I just kind of fell in love with it after a test drive.,
2013,22-03-2015,1,0.7783,4.875, I test drove many cars looking for a cost effective economical car that would be a fun everyday driver while still be great on gas.  I test drove a Mini Cooper S convertible for 7 days and found it to be a noisy cheap car that really felt like a poorly built cheap car (shame on you BMW).  I looked at the beetle (just ok) focus (awful style) fiesta (nothing more to say) and many more but just could not find the fun factor I wanted.  Then I happened upon a Fiat Abarth 500C and thought that looked interesting.  I test drove it ... and wow ... it was incredible.  It was perfect!  It had the fun factor with the exhaust note convertible 5-speed and the power is great.  It also gets great gas mileage low insurance cost can seat 4 (yes the back seats are small but work just fine) feels solid/stable and best of all a low mileage used car can be found for under 19k ... and then I find that the warranty is 4 years/50k ... Bonus!  I have since put over 25000 trouble free miles on this car including a couple of long distance trips.  This car never fails to make me smile and always a willing partner to have some fun.  On top of that I get many comments on how nice the car looks because it is a limited edition Abarth 500c.  For 2013 there were only 250 imported to the USA ... so it is extremely rare to even see another one.  LOVE my car!,
2013,23-03-2015,1,0.9974,4,after 11000 miles in just under 3 months not a single problem  rattle  or squeak . Maybe I bite the bullet and go for an Orange Turbo at the end of the year anything but silver or grey . I'm sick of seeing silver cars .,
2013,03-03-2017,1,-0.5455,4, I have always purchased new vehicles so was quite concerned buying a used lease vehicle make by Fiat. But after a month I am impressed with this little electric car! I decided to investigate leasing an electric while idling my V-8 in commute traffic and ended up buying this Fiat. With the gas and bridge toll savings this used car will pay for itself in about 5 years plus reduced wear and maintenance on my Jeep. The biggest downside so far is the lack of Fiat service centers.,
2013,16-04-2013,2,-0.2244,5,With the 17-inch wheels and P-zero tires this light weight car feels fast and nimble not always stable on the edge. Provided you keep it in the mid-rev range the torque is strong and turbo lag is not an issue. ,
2013,15-05-2013,2,0.0031,4.875, I am an old dude 53 I have a Light seafoam green with ivory interior 2013 500 pop 5 speed with a sunroof  alum wheels and beats stereo  on top of all the other goodies that just come standard on this car . It rocks  fun  fast  stable quiet  I've owned one of just about everything over the years from Pintos to Porsches  literally. This is hands down one of my favorites. My only complaint is that the turbo doesn't come in ANY color I want!,
2013,20-05-2014,2,0.8172,4.25,  Abarth is ultimately more fun than my old mustang or Z a little power house that doesn't shy away from a fight love the engine growl and the kick more room than you think awesome bang for the buck .,
2013,28-05-2014,2,0.9008,5,Exhaust is great fun meaty and quick turbo engine good grip extremely easy to park in those spaces no one else can fit in.  I love the pops and backfires when you lift off the throttle quickly or when changing gears.  I like the high seating position. I really like the old style analog concentric gauge cluster--I have no problem quickly interpreting the data as some have reported.  Looks are great with the gray-tint headlight/tail light option.  I like the Abarth stripes--what the heck might as well with a car like this!,
2013,07-06-2014,2,0.9806,4.5, When Fiat left the US market oh so long ago I was not happy.,
2013,28-07-2015,3,-0.4585,5,This car replaced a turbo diesel car so needing fast acceleration was not a requirement. The first week of ownership I put mine and my wife's road bikes on the back and took off on a thousand mile drive to participate in a week long bike ride in Northern Idaho. We had to cross the continental divide and drive over many types of roads. This car has extremely comfortable seats and except for the extreme climbs has enough power. We averaged 35 mpg for the trip. Since then it is averaging 35-39 mpg with mostly city driving. We have had no problems great a/c and no rattles. Love this CAR,
2013,04-08-2015,3,0.7778,5,By that time I had owned a very used 128 wagon a new X-1/9 and then a new 131 Brava.,
2013,30-09-2015,3,0,5, You have to try it.. you may love or hate it - but it really is a fun car for 'enthusiast' drivers. Great value provided you don't pay the MSRP (I got mine (with 3 year tire insurance - which I already used once for a repair) for 19K US$ + tax with end of year discounts of 6K.),
2013,07-09-2016,3,0.9461,5,If Fiat sold the awd 500x with the  six speed in the US I would buy one.,
2013,19-09-2016,3,0,5,Fun the most fun than any car I have ever own worth every penny a pleasure to drive.,
2013,08-12-2012,4,0.9099,4.375,I did and I do so I was thrilled when Fiat returned to our market.,
2013,01-11-2013,4,0.4902,4.75, Just leased this. Really impressed with fit finish and fun to drive performance! Easy to exceed rated MPGe. With sweet lease deal total cost of car is less than I was spending on gasoline alone each month. Range is OK better than others except Tesla and Volt. Getting by with included slooow 120V charge device others may desire $800 optional fast charger. Costs $1 per day for electricity to drive 40 miles previous vehicle was $10 per day for gas. Very impressive car hope future models offer extended range and lower cost batteries. My SUV will last forever now parked except when needed!,
2013,09-11-2013,4,0.9799,5, I have now had the Fiat for 30 months. I still love the car. I have had no problems with it  and the dealership where I bought it gives great service. The only complaint that I have is that with the stock tires that it does not do well in deep snow. This is only a problem on my street which is not plowed.,
2013,14-12-2013,4,-0.0808,4.5, 1500 miles on my 500e. Lease $200 month. $2500 total down $2500 rebate from state of CA. Aero environment 220 charger installed today compliments of State of CA. Est monthly fuel cost to drive 1000 miles approx $35 per SMUD utility rep. 500e total car expenditure less than gas and routine maintenance alone on my MB C230...like winning a free car in a contest. Enough ACCT 101. This little thing is pretty fun. Very spunky and quick off the line. Easily separates from ICE cars off green lights. Great around town car or 2nd car. I drove it 95 miles very gently today and had 10% charge left. ,
2013,15-12-2013,4,0.9733,4.875,Yikes! Slams itself into park if you turn off key while still rolling slowly--- this is a recall/safety problem for sure!  Tires noisy can't help it-- super quiet and it's all you hear! A bit rough riding but the wheelbase is only a bit longer than my dog...,
2013,19-12-2013,4,-0.6283,5,Loaded features hard to pick one-- Bluetooth phone heated seats Sat radio...,
2013,01-11-2015,4,-0.1027,5,Update 35000 miles still having fun..range is about 85-90 miles now..,
2013,23-11-2016,4,0,5, I love the looks and handling. This would make an awesome commuting car; however it would be a little tight for passengers in the back seats. The typical downsides are minimal range (<100 miles) and takes at least four hours to charge from 'empty.',
2014,06-01-2014,1,0.8519,2.25,To start off I love the transmission but I've adapted my driving habits to ensure its longevity. It is after all an automatically shifted manual- not a slush box.  What I'm talking about is for example to select the gear you want using the manual mode when in stop and go traffic in particular when you're creeping along and I always put it in neutral if I'm going to be stopped for any length of time. The reasons for driving the DDCT in this way are a bit technical and maybe that's why dual clutch transmissions haven't caught on so well stateside. In any case for 2015 all but the Pop trim come with the Aisin slush box if you opt for an auto transmission. ,
2014,16-02-2014,1,0.5126,4.875,We now have a son who is almost 1 and he's spent his entire life thus far riding in this car.  With the car seat in the middle it's a little cramped in the back but nothing bad. ,
2014,21-02-2014,1,0.5824,5,This vehicle has all the features of the pricier Honda CRV at about 5K less -- and it looks better and handles better on the road. Last month I took it on a 800 miles road trip and it was so enjoyable to drive.,
2014,28-03-2014,1,0.8605,4.625,The smooth shifting 6 speed manual.  1.4 turbo that is very willing.  Huge interior for a car this small.  Bluetooth Nav backup camera.  Value.  These cars are CHEAP now that theyve got a bad rap.  From what Ive heard avoid the automatic and youll be fine or wait for the 2015 and its conventional automatic tranny.  New 2014 ones are deeply discounted and I just bought a used 2014 in Jan of 2015 with only 3k miles for $12500!  You cant beat that value with any other car on the market!!  Heck I love it when Consumer reports blasts a perfectly good car.  Just makes them that much cheaper to buy!!  Give this car a chance if you can drive a stick.  You wont regret it!!!,
2014,24-02-2015,1,0.9463,4.625, Like someone else said this is one of the most underrated small cars on the market today.  It's well documented that Americans don't like wagons or minivans for that matter.  Well apparently neither do most auto journalists because this car is lambasted in every pupublication.  Just go drive one for yourself these are TONS of fun. In Colorado here at this elevation Turbos and their forced induction rule the land.  Maybe in Texas at sea level this car seems pokey but in this thin air this 1.4 direct inject turbo runs hard and is a blast to drive. I upgraded from a Mini Clubman and LOVE the fact I can fit 3 car seats wide.  To be fair I have the 6 speed manual so no automatic problems here.,
2014,12-01-2016,1,0.8047,5, We've had our 500L for 2 years now though have only put on 14K miles so far and it's my wife's daily driver. Ours is the Trekking trim with the 6 speed Dual-Dry-Clutch Transmission. In response to an earlier recent review where the reviewer gave the car just 1 star my experience couldn't be more different. ,
2014,29-01-2016,1,0,4, Overall this has been a good car for us.  We've taken a number of long-ish trips (3-8 hours in the car) and we've never had an issue.  It's a comfortable ride (I'm 5'10 my wife 5'4 and we both fit comfortably in front or in back. ,
2014,02-02-2016,1,0.8957,4, I have put 45000 miles on my 500L Trekking in 27 months. It is driven 3-5 days a week to work 24 miles one way. I have made numerous trips of 300 to 450 miles one way. I find the front seats become uncomfortable only on the longest trips. I track my MPG since new and average 30.3 MPG. My best is 39.8. I have the auto transmission and I did have to get used to it. It does not always shift smoothly. I had a problem with the engine check light due to a fuel vac leak. The leak was never found and the problem stopped over a year and a half ago. I love the dashboard. I like a simple layout and feel the FIAT gives it to me. The view from the drivers seat is beyond compare. Cargo room is great. I can carry 2x4x8 boards in the car. It has been a great little car. The TECH package was the selling point for me. The backup camera is awesome.,
2014,24-02-2016,1,0.91,5, I bought this new in March of 2015. Advertised $8000 off MSRP. Great buy.  The turbo kicks in @ 3000 rpm's and it becomes a rocket! Easy access massive headroom.  I have 10000 miles and no problems.  I personally love the European Automatic Transmission (DCA). Feels like a manual without the clutch Most new 2016 models at the dealers have an American Automatic. Guess some people didn't like the DCA. Plenty of trunk space Always get great mileage.,
2014,25-03-2016,1,0.9493,5,Overall I consider the Fiat Abarth to be an excellent alternative to a big sport touring bike for those of us who have outgrown (literally and figuratively) motorcycles.  Evening blasts through the countryside w/ the windows down cruising around town listening to the burbling exhaust running it up through the gears and stints on the interstate are all at least 95% as much fun as I'd have on a motorcycle.  The roof windshield wipers HVAC heated seats stereo airbags luggage space and relative comfort (for two!) more than make up for the other 5% of lost performance and 'freedom'.  And my lightly used Abarth was much cheaper than any of the big sport touring bikes.,
2014,06-06-2015,2,0.7424,2.75,The trunk doesn't fit the jogger stroller very well well just enough for the stroller and nothing else.  It will fit in the front seat (upside down) but it makes reaching the shifter a bit awkward.  We really should have gotten a larger car but my wife LOVED the unique look of the car and the fact that you just don't see many of them around.,
2014,04-04-2016,2,0.8415,4, I loved my 2012 500c but found myself needing something a little larger.,
2014,08-04-2016,2,0.3506,5,UPDATE - The Abarth continues to impress!  I've put about 5000 miles on it and everything continues to work as it should.  Overall fuel mileage remains 30 mpg average in mixed driving.  I recently took the Abarth on a nice long road trip up to PA and it was great fun hurtling along the backroads of MD and eastern PA.  Third and 4th gears are perfect for that kind of thing.  The Abarth is surprisingly comfortable on the Interstate but I prefer secondary roads if only to allow me to use the gearbox more!  Many folks complain about the shifter but I find that it works just fine.  The throws might be a tad on the long side but engagement is precise and shifts can be very smooth.  The leather wrapped Abarth steering wheel and shifter are both a pleasure to use.  The 'sport' button on the dashboard provides a noticeable bump in power but I usually don't bother w/ it.  The brakes are VERY good.  As noted by some others the turning diameter is about the same as most mid sized SUVs which is surprising.  Apparently the Abarth modifications to the front suspension required it.  I've adjusted but it's ironic to drive such a small car and have to plan ahead in some parking situations as if you were driving a truck.,
2014,25-04-2016,2,0.9825,4,UPDATE Sept. 28 2016 - I'm over a year in with my used 2014 Abarth and I still love it.  A ball joint started creaking in the front suspension but that was repaired under the excellent 4 year/50000 mile bumper to bumper warranty.  At my rate of driving I'll be able to enjoy full warranty coverage through August of 2018!  My local Fiat service department is primarily a Dodge shop and customer service is TERRIBLE.  But the Fiat mechanics seem solid and the annual oil change was only $68 for full synthetic. The Abarth has proven to be very reliable and I'm looking forward to some autumn road trips.  I added a $15 Bluetooth dongle for the aux input and now I can enjoy streaming music from my phone as well as the standard Bluetooth phone integration.  Later models have better Bluetooth capability standard.  Bottom line - If you are looking for a fun inexpensive second car you should definitely test drive a 500 Abarth.  The bang for the buck is tremendous and it's an absolute blast to bomb around in.,
2014,21-06-2016,2,0.9732,4, It's a shame this car has gotten such bad press. I know some have had bad experiences but I've read about others who have had wonderful experiences with this car. You can almost park this car almost anywhere -- I believe it's length is a few inches shorter than a Toyota Corolla -- yet it has such room inside for passengers and cargo. It's not a sports car but it handles well enough and rides comfortably on all but the roughest or bumpiest roads. As of this writing I have had no issues at all; just normal maintenance. The bad press has probably affected sales so look carefully for a good deal if you're shopping for one.,
2014,19-05-2017,2,0.5295,5, This is so much fun to drive.,
2014,19-07-2013,3,0.5542,5,So what am I to do?? Not drive the car in USA stop and go traffic?!,
2014,13-08-2013,3,-0.4646,3.375," I really like my new 500L but it does not like me. After 6 days 350ml it broke down in stop and go traffic on I-25 outside Denver. The twin clutch automatic heated up smoked and therefore the system shut down. Had roadside assistance tow it back to the Fiat dealer. After setting for three days the car started okay and was drivable. The dealer could not find any problems the engineer in Italy could not find any problem with the readout data. Their comment was that with the stop and go traffic the 500L twin clutch automatic acted ""normally"".",
2014,21-07-2014,3,0.5283,5,I do hate to see Fiat get such a bad rep.  Even though I have the stick shift it would be nice to see the 500l have less problems especially with the auto.  Mine had the cold start problems but was correctly diagnosed by the dealer to be a weak battery from the factory. The service advisor said that many of these 500 L came here with bad batteries possibly due to sitting in the shipping yard for a few months. With a fresh battery it has given me zero problems starting on some of these cold Colorado mornings.,
2014,31-08-2014,3,-0.9309,4.75,Fiat USA is still working with me so hopefully there will be a positive outcome.,
2014,26-09-2015,3,0.7959,5, I love my Abarth.  It's our second car but we've already taken it on one long road trip.  It is a very fun car to drive and feels much faster than it is.  I'm surprised how comfortable it is given all the negative press I've read.  For 2 six foot adults the car is perfectly comfortable.  Miles per gallon are better than EPA estimates but smiles per gallon are off the charts.  The touch points in the cabin are very nice even if there is a lot of hard plastic.  No complaints at all.  Comfortable fun economical practical and it sounds awesome when you run it up through the gears!  Buy a lightly used one and you won't regret it.,
2014,01-10-2014,4,0.9932,5,Some criticize the 500L for having too firm of a ride but to me it is sublime giving a very nice balance between ride and handling. The steering weights up nicely as you turn in though I wish the turn-in response were a little sharper. It is very stable once into a corner and it's fun to hustle it if you're in the mood though the car is really excellent at just cruising on a sunny day esp. if you've opted for the panoramic roof.,
2014,19-10-2014,4,0.9858,4.125, I bought a Fiat 500L Trekking in September 2013. To be honest it took me quite awhile to get used to its rather quirky transmission -- and I have a manual!! The issue was the six gears and the need for a quick shift between first and second. But now that I have gotten used to how and when to shift I am very happy with my purchase.,
2014,18-12-2015,4,0.835,5,I traded in the cabrio for the new 500L and am very pleased with it so far.,
2014,28-12-2015,4,0.4927,1," I've had no problem with the car rolling backwards on a slight incline when pulling away from a stop and hill hold assist works well when on any incline greater than ""slight"".  The engine has proven to be plenty quick enough for merging with traffic etc. and frugal if you're easy on the gas. I've gotten upwards of 39 mpg when on back roads with no traffic 34 or so on interstates 25 to 27 in town (lots of cold starts routinely so the economy suffers a bit for that).  ",
2015,22-01-2015,1,-0.6326,5, I bought my 2015 fiat 500 pop six months ago from Car Pros Fiat of Renton that's when my troubles started... at the first rain I found out that my car has a leak car did not have even 500 miles when I took it to get serviced in staid of giving me a new car they repaired it and this is only the beginning.... stereo problem done the software update no changes had the engine check light that went on  the heater takes 20 MIN to defog at full power driver seat latch sticks and now another leak. The car has only 3030 miles and it has been repaired 6 times. Till this moment Fiat USA and the dealership is still giving me the turn around. After a months of calling and sending emails I finally got an answer from fiat acknowledging that there is problems with this car and they offer an extended warranty... really  you think I will keep a car with so many problems. Now I found water again in the back of my car it's three times now.,
2015,22-02-2015,1,-0.9062,5,It has lots of room both front and back and handles like a European Car should handle. It cuts and turns quickly and holds the road beautifully. All of that while maintaining a comfortable ride.,
2015,10-03-2015,1,0.8074,4.875," Although the MSRP is $16000 I paid $13000 for a brand new 2015 model on Black Friday after a lot of negotiating. While the price is the best feature of this car putting an affordable nice new car within reach of anyone at any income level the FIAT just has so many other great qualities on top of that. It gets 40 miles per gallon on the freeway and I average 34 including city driving in my typical commute. It easily reaches freeway speeds and feels very safe and comfortable at 75 MPH. It has excellent handling in all circumstances. The interior was actually ""designed"" not ""thrown together."" The manual transmission is very fun to drive with even when it's not in sport mode.",
2015,23-03-2015,1,0.9839,5, After one year of ownership I fully stand by my first review.,
2015,14-01-2016,1,0,5," Lease terms are great when combined with rebates from California State and Central Valley.   Car is a hoot to drive: fast and responsive with great handling.   It also is cute and sophisticated looking.   Range is about 100 miles in the relatively flat Central Valley.   This car works great as a city commuter and carries our shopping purchases easily in the ""trunk"" and the extra space made by folding down the rear seats.  We are family of two ""empty nesters"" so although this car is an addition to our gas engine vehicles (bought to complement our newly installed solar array on the rooftop) it has become the favorite car to use.   Front seats are fine but rear seats are a bit cramped.  Controls are ""interesting"" reflecting Italian design!!   The integrated info system in 2016 is a bit improvement over previous models.  In addition the interior white/black color scheme is practical but classy.   We have had no problem in the city or on the highway.  Beware that this car does not allow Level 3 charging so expect to wait a bit longer for it to charge with Level 2 at public charing stations or a lot longer with the Level 1 charger that comes with the car.",
2015,19-01-2016,1,0.9421,1,This is a follow up to the review I did last year. I have put about 7000 miles on her like I said I don't drive much and she is still doing great. I really have no complaints at all about this car. We even traded in our Mini for the 500X and we love it as well.,
2015,06-02-2016,1,0.8155,4, Let me first say I bought my 2015 Fiat pop on a whim I didn't need the car I had a Dodge Journey RT and loved it but honestly I wanted to see if my bank would allow me to have a second car they did! So I bought my Fiat 500 pop automatic in the color coffee brown. Now personally I wish I got the abarth I'm not sure why I didn't test drive it prior to my purchase but what's done is done. My pop is cute it's practical I average 29.6 mpg with tires low tire pressure light on to 34 mpg with good road and weather conditions. My best mpg for around town mixed with freeway was 39mpg! That was done after I washed my car and engine bay. So mpg is reasonable gas cost for me $20-24 depending where I go to fill up. Yes that is all I pay at the pumps for a full tank of gas! :) after 1 year of owning the car I started to lose a hubcap so I took them all off and saved them. Car looks better without hub caps :) size of the car is awesome! I can fit in any parking spot I can get in and out of traffic with ease people let me merge into lanes because my car is so small and most other fiat drivers are super nice! I do any repairs myself minus oil changes I pay for full synthetic and it cost me around $100 every 5000 miles. Charlie Brown my car has not given me any issues since I purchased it brand new in November of 2014. I have about 19k miles on it. I always feel safe driving it sure I can't beat my fiancées VW golf TDI off the line but Charlie always gets me where I need to go and never lets me down. So what I don't like about the car is the cup holders! They annoy me I can't get to large cups from McDonald's to sit perfectly next to each other. :( I feel the layout of the cup holders could have been better thought out the sun visors or a bit short and don't always block out the sun but adjust your seat to a higher level and it works out ok. The arm rest my pop only came with one! Um... Yea there is a fix to this an aftermarket arm rest that can be installed but you lose your cup holders in the back part of the car doing this. One cool and safe feature is if it's raining and your backing up your rear window wiper automatically starts to clear the back window allowing you to see where your going! Smart thinking Fiat! I have programmed all my doors to unlock with just one touch of the Key FOB. Radio works great the car heater and ax works superb! Seeing that the car is so small it doesn't Take much to cool or heat up. So in closing I have a love hate relationship with my car more love than hate would I buy the car again? Heck yes! It's cheap to own easy to fix although nothing has broken yet for me I have installed a few extra gadgets for the car like hydraulic support arms for my hood. Replacement engines cost about a grand sometimes less. I plan to own this car till the frame falls apart lol I'll replace the engines when the time comes. I think for what it's worth this is a great first car collage bound car for your child good for retired people not to family friendly due to size but if you had to you could. I'll give this car an 8/10 for overall satisfaction! Thanks for reading don't let the little things like cup holders get to you just work with it every car has its flaw. Take care of your car and it will take care of you.,
2015,15-02-2016,1,0.9992,5,The appearance means a lot to me also as it is highly unique and does not have the cookie cutter design that most cars have.,
2015,05-03-2016,1,0,5,I noticed that it stands just a few inches short of my 2003 Chevy Venture van.,
2015,28-03-2016,1,0,5," The 500 turbo - slotting in between the non-turbo models on the low-end and more powerful turbo Abarth model on the high end is definitely a bit of a ""goldilocks"" fit for people interested in commuting. This is my second FIAT purchased new and I'm generally pretty pleased with the car. My one modification is the exhaust system like that of the Abarth - a loud open exhaust. This car will turn heads because of the sound - in a good way (it doesn't sound like a fart-can Civic from Fast and the Furious but more like the sensational Alfa Romeo 4C). In any case this car is a competent handler once you get used to the high-riding seats. It's easy to drive in stop-and-go traffic with simple hydraulic clutch that has nice progressive engagement and a snappy five-speed stick with fairly close ratios. If you're nice this is a car easily capable of beating it's EPA ratings especially on the freeway where I've seen averages approach 45mpg. And even if you're naughty you're still going to struggle to do worse than 25mpg city which is great fuel economy for a turbocharged car with a close-ratio gearbox being driven inefficiently. With the seats folded you're going to be able to carry plenty of groceries and even with them up you can fit luggage for two on a weekend getaway. Yes the newer Fiats can stream audio over bluetooth and have infotainment stuff but that's not the point of this car. What this thing is is simple: it's the cheapest performance-oriented turbo car for sale in the US and it's a real driver's car. Your money is buying not just the 240000rpm turbo which pushes 15-18psi of boost but you're getting a forged crankshaft and pistons with oil sprayers to keep those pistons cool. You get twin intercoolers an upgraded transmission and the most notable thing - upgraded brakes (bigger rotors performance pads). The brakes are among the grabbiest and firmest you'll find in anything for sale for less than $40000. They are probably the best brakes period on a car that stickers for < $20k. All of this makes for a compelling little car that wants you to be happy and have fun. If you look at a grey Yaris or silver Fit and think that cars like that are a punishment this is the car you want. It's a pitbull puppy that wants to tear the face off of your coworker's Fiesta. It wants you to take the backroads and have a laugh. It doesn't take itself too seriously and reminds you to live life and have fun. Now a final word about these cars: in the same way that they're not boring Honda or Toyota products in the ways mentioned above they are very Italian in one other way - they need a little TLC. Mine has had a few little things (power window motor needing adjustment bluetooth software issues) dealt with under warranty. If you look at other reviews people seem to lose their cool about this stuff which is unfortunate because it can happen with any car. Especially if you decide to buy a turbo car (any turbo car not just a Fiat) be aware that maintenance matters a lot more as does paying attention to things like fluids. Turbo cars like the Fiat may use a little oil (consume not leak)  between oil changes - it's a good idea to keep an eye on it. The sticky Pirelli tires that come on this car from the factory aren't going to last 50000 miles like the crappy eco tires on the Yaris. But if you love cars and are willing to spend a little extra effort and patience loving this one it's get to to 50000 smiles guaranteed.",
2015,13-02-2017,1,0.9986,5, I purchased a used low mileage 2015 Fiat 500e a couple of months ago and was so impressed with how it handles that I purchased another for my sister.  These cars are a real steal on the used car market.  I live in South Florida where it is warm and flat and generally have been getting over 100 miles of range (EPA 87).  A Fiat 500 in general is not the most practical car but if you want something really fun to drive this is it.   This car handles very similar to my former Mini Cooper but without the gas.,
2015,20-02-2017,1,0.7674,5, I recommend this car to anyone that is looking for a car that feels like it came from the distant future of the automotive industry. We purchased a used Fiat 500e and we are very happy with it. We test drove about 8 Fiat 500e at different dealerships until we found one that we liked. We studied the car and read many reviews before making the choice to buy the car. The battery is the most expensive part of the car and Fiat provides an 8 year or 100000 mile warranty on the battery.,
2015,29-03-2017,1,0.8955,5,The visibility is amazing! With large windows all around and front pillar split by glass and wraparound rear windows. I also own a VW Touareg and honestly have better visibility in this Fiat.  Features like the rear backup camera rear park assist system and  hands-free phone connectivity add to safety and convenience. The 17-inch wheels hold the road well even when driving on the freeway in rain. ,
2015,06-06-2015,2,0.9485,4.375,Yes I was concerned with the professional ratings and reviews but my experience has been all positive. I have not experienced  the brake fade some reviewers did.,
2015,29-06-2015,2,0.775,5, I was looking at another car in the used car section of the Fiat dealer. I liked the way the Fiat looked so decided to give it a drive. Turned out I really liked this cute little car. So bought it that day. Red with automatic transmission. I can see where some of the interior parts will likely not hold up well but for the money and styling I think it's a great deal. I don't really drive a lot anymore and this is really perfect for me. Comfortable peppy and fun to look at. ,
2015,07-04-2016,2,0.9795,5, This is the 11th new car I have purchased and this is one of the most enjoyable. My 2015 500L is a pleasure to drive. This vehicle has received  more than a few negative professional reviews  but I strongly disagree. Yes the center armrest is narrow but it is functional. I do not mind the emergency brake handle location. The car provides a great view of the road and the seating position is excellent. The ride is tuned to a good level in my opinion. I live in Chicago and this car has proven to be easy to park in tight city street spaces while providing excellent interior volume. Great cargo space for those larger purchases. Highway performance is also good I have averaged 33 mpg.  My children love this car and prefer to ride in it vs our Ford Taurus. ,
2015,20-04-2016,2,0.994,5,It's a quick car and still has decent acceleration at 60+ mph. It handles and grips well is a lot of fun as a daily driver well at least when there isn't too much traffic.,
2015,02-05-2016,2,0.7579,5, Having owned a fiat 128 Sedan Fiat 128 3P Fiat Bravo and Fiat Spyder 2000 and loved them all I thought I would give Fiat another try since my wife has had a trouble free 500 Sport since 2012 with no problems.,
2015,18-05-2016,2,0.1531,4,I experienced a clutch pressure plate failure at only 255 miles. However roadside assistance is included for free with the purchase of a new FIAT so I got it home on my own and got it towed to the dealership for free and got the clutch replaced for free in-warranty. While that was of course disappointing I was provided with a nice FIAT 500 Sport loaner car for free that was fun to drive and now that the clutch is fixed there have been no further issues and the car has been very reliable. While that was a rather concerning start to get off to I now feel very safe that this car is reliable enough to take anywhere. I wish they offered the diesel here but the gas engine is nice.,
2015,20-05-2016,2,0.8967,5, I rented one a year or so ago for an 800+ trip. I really liked how it handled and the gas mileage was awesome. So I saved up and bought my own.,
2015,20-05-2016,2,0.883,1,All in all for the price I paid I feel very satisfied with my new car and must admit I enjoy the compliments from those who notice it in the bright yellow and black combination. The gloss black instrument panel bezels are a beautiful upgrade included in the Urbana Trekking Collection 1.,
2015,04-06-2016,2,0.9485,5, I've had my Abarth about 6 weeks now.  I park in a crowded parking lot at work as far as I can tell its the only one on the lot.  It stands out.  Mine is red with the upgraded $500 sixteen inch wheels.  The best feature of this car is its compelling value and its unbeatable fun factor.  I was originally shopping for the Sport which I test drove and loved probably should have bought for the gas mileage alone and almost equally cool in appearance and appeal as the Abarth.  But I loved the Abarth too particularly the exhaust badging and leather seats.  Keep in mind the exhaust is great exhaust porn to the extreme great at drive thru's and underpasses will put a smile on you face every day best described as a friendly companion and not at all intrusive.  Its absolutely fab!  If I'm careful I can average around 35 MPG on a tank with 60% of that a suburban commute to work.  I keep it out of sport mode for the most part just to save on fuel.  The Beats audio system is good very good but I can't imagine the base system also not being very good.  I did not do the comparison before I purchased.  Seems all the 500s I was interested in had the Beats so I just went with it.  Also no backup camera but it does have the backup warning feature a $250 option that I feel is very useful and well worth it.  Driving this car with the stick is easy and fun.  I think it's is the only way to go because of the gain in MPG and the fun factor.  Also the fit and finish is perfect.  I examined it with a magnifying glass no paint blemishes of any kind no gaps in the panels or doors (as compared to my 2005 Maxima purchased new a Nissan embarrassment for which I will never give them a second chance.  Shame shame shame on Nissan).  The ride quality is also great no rattles at all a little bouncy because of the small wheel base but an able and compliant suspension as well as a handling marvel.  Road noise is minimal this is a small car from the outside but doesn't sound like it from the inside.  I test drove a Honda Fit didn't like it but was willing to buy based alone on Honda reliability.  The front suspension gave the impression of the wheels trying to come thru the wheel wells let alone the road noise.  This car may be reliable and have great reviews but I don't see why.  It's a cheap car with a cheap price that will make you feel cheap as long as you own it.  Also the dealer played the online bait and switch despite having the online quote in their very hands.  This happened at two dealerships within a week.  Done with arrogant Honda... forever!  Thank you Honda for being rotten I think I've gotten a better car for a better price.  Also the electronics are all that.  Perhaps all new cars now come with sophisticated electronics but please be aware this was an inexpensive car where the fun price and appearance are its strengths.  The electronics are a bonus that bring it up to the standards of much more expensive cars.  Also the interior and electronics are intuitive and easy to use.  This is no accident it is well thought out design.  It's not just a lot of features thrown together haphazardly like my Maxima for bragging rights.  This is a comfortable car in many many respects.  The high roof line allows for more space then can be imagined.  This car does not feel cramped and you sit up high its easy in and easy out which gives great comfort to my aching right hip.  I also looked at the new Civic.  A great car if you don't mind spending north of $27K for the one you want with the wheels you want and you have to do the limbo to get into the darn thing for the privilege of nearly sitting on the ground.  Its great once you're in but you may need 911 to get out.  My hip and checkbook feel the Fiat is not just the better car its the smarter car too... and better looking.   I can't say enough about how great a value I feel this car is.  Also this is a specialty car and the dealer lots are full of unsold Abarths.  Most people I think will fall for the 500 but the real car people of which there are fewer will look to the Abarth with an appreciation of how different and special this car really is.  Consequently huge and disproportionate discounts are to be had.  My car listed for $27495 (no sunroof no navigation) final price $22295.  I think I overpaid and could have done better by about $2000 without even asking had I used some online tools.  But I don't feel bad about the purchase.  I liked the dealer patient and kind easy and nice.  The follow up has been nothing less then remarkable.  I feel like I've joined the family and a special community.  The dealer followed up and FIAT themselves too after receiving several welcome gifts.  Any problems call and a person will answer who is able to give answers.  I will remember this as a pleasant experience it the car proves itself as reasonably durable which I think it will then I'll stick with FIAT.  They have put a priceless smile on my face.,
2015,30-06-2016,2,0.9996,5, I bought a 500L Trekking I'm 2014. After half a year of smooth sailing a crazy person ran a red light and almost killed me. I had four surgeries. The car saves my life. The frame held up despite the awful crash. Now I bought a new leftover 2015 600L Easy. I missed this car so much. I'm glad to be alive and happy to be on the road with this dependable and absolutely adorable car!!,
2015,16-05-2017,2,0.9095,3, Blind spots! Get to know you blind spots.  Sluggish acceleration.  Top heavy. Love the size the look and so far the reliability.,
2015,31-08-2014,3,-0.3382,4.75," I've owned four 500s since the model was introduced in 2012. Started with a Pop went to an Abarth then to a Sport and am back in the fold with a new 2015 Sport. Subtle refinements to the 2015 are much appreciated especially the new electronic instrument cluster. I have owned way too many cars but I think the Fiat may be my favorite all around vehicle. FUN to drive wonderful design inside and out frugal with fuel easy to maneuver and park great driving position and sight lines. Get the Sport model engage the ""sport"" button and enjoy one of the best kept secrets in the new car market.",
2015,28-07-2015,3,0.992,5, I've had this for around 8-10 months so I can't really say much on long term reliability but its a fun little car.,
2015,31-08-2015,3,0.6652,5, Really do not understand the negative press reviews for this car.  This is my second FIAT trading up from the 500 to the 500L.  I've come to the conclusion that people in this country reject things that are different or unique.  The design of the 500L is ingenious - for its size it has amazing interior volume.  The ride is very comfortable and it has a great seating position sitting higher than many crossovers.  I'm not sure why the press reviews say the car is under-powered. The engine is turbocharged and - at least in mine - when I hit the pedal that car MOVES!  It handles quite well and is fun to drive even for as tall as it is.  Most reviewers have highly criticized the looks of the 500L but I have only gotten nice compliments on it.  With all those windows the high seating position and spotter mirrors on both sides all around visibility is amazing!  FIAT has some quirky features and design elements but I think they make the car all that more appealing.  Some of the interior trim could be nicer but most cars today are filled with hard plastics - most of the hard plastic surfaces are slightly textured so I don't think they look cheap.  I have almost 20000 miles on mine and aside from routine maintenance the only issue I've had was with a rattle in the back (fixed by the dealer on the first visit).  FIAT stands behind their products with an impressive 4 year/50000 mile warranty too.  On one hand it is a shame this car doesn't sell better but I have never been one to drive what everyone else is driving so I like driving what I consider to be the best keep secret out there!  I would absolutely but another one without any hesitation.  Do yourself a favor - ignore the press critics and focus on the reviews of people who drive these cars day in and day out.,
2015,31-07-2016,3,0.9893,5,"No parking aids on my but then again whats the point. just aiming it in the general direction is good enough. It's small enough where i can just go ""Eh good enough"" and it is.",
2015,20-08-2016,3,0.7964,5,This is a nice car that is truly affordable and accessible to all with unique features that make it fun to drive but also practical. Driving it also feels quite safe considering what a small car it is and that is a very important quality if you have children. Even though it doesn't have 4 doors I can fit my daughter's rear-facing car seat into it without too much trouble by simply sliding the driver's seat forward to put her in and moving it back again after her carseat clicks into it's seatbelted base. With my wife in the passenger seat the carseat clicked into place and 40 MPG we don't have to be stuck at home not going anywhere on weekends held hostage by gas prices anymore.,
2015,31-07-2017,3,0.9389,1, This car is cheaply made. I leased 2015 500e already the charging cable is broken and the plugin part is loose and the prongs that fit into the outlet is burning y outlet. The house almost caught on fire! Customer service is really bad and could not even tell me if the charging cable is under warranty. My car has only 15K miles!!! It's now in the shop and can't drive it as can't charge it!!!,
2015,14-10-2015,4,-0.8749,5,I traded in my luxury ride Buick Century for a 500L and I am in love with it. It has plenty enough power to get you on the interstate and cruise at the traditional 5 mph above the speed limit as well as get you in and out of tight spots. I especially love the option of running the gears yourself with the optional 6 speed automatic.,
2015,20-10-2015,4,0.8885,5, Great commuter car also a total blast to city drive.  Regenerative brakes are sweet and seem better than conventional great acceleration amazing that they make vehicles like this.  The only real downside I noted (aside from a limited range) is that going uphill really drains the batteries fast shortening the range.  That aside it is really roomy in the front the back clearly not popular with most.  You buy the EV that suits your needs- as we were looking at a commuter car this was by far the best choice.,
2015,22-10-2015,4,0.9722,3, PROS:  This car is really nimble in the city.  We live in San Francisco so parking is rarely a problem for this car.  This car is great at stop and go.  Often you can drive more than 100 miles in the city.  It has good handling and is fairly comfortable in the front seat.  CONS:  My worst complaint is the highway mileage.  If driving around 65 mph continuously don't expect the range to go beyond 60-70 miles.  Also when you turn on AC you lose about 10 (estimated) miles in range so be careful.  Back seat is horrible in terms of space.  Trunk space is small but for a family of three it's big enough to hold our weekend groceries.  I like the interior design but the quality of material is really cheap so I don't think it's worth the price tag.  Everyone was laughing at the bright orange but this bright color is necessary because sometimes on the road people just don't see this compact car.  Reliability and safety are unknown at this point since I am not a pro.  Overall I'd recommend this car for short distance commuters.,
2015,01-11-2015,4,0.9685,5,The driving position is quite high coming from my 98' BMW but it somehow just adds to the fun.,
2015,10-11-2015,4,0.6652,5,My car came with the Beats audio system and I frequently have too adjust the base level down as it is tuned too a level way too high.,
2015,14-11-2015,4,0,5," I had been waiting for the 2016 models to come out but I found the body on the 2015 500L Trekking model to be a far more attractive and more Italian look. I ended up buying the 2015 500L Trekking with the ""Beats"" sound system with SiriusXM satellite radio AISIN Heavy Duty 6-speed automatic transmission and U-connect touch screen. I use it for driving around San Francisco with all the hills and find it handles well. I love the headlights that move to follow your turns and curves. It is very easy to fold down the rear seats and create a spacious flat cargo area. The back seats also have the ability to recline to an almost flat bed like seat. The dual climate control keeps the front seat passengers happy and as the driver I enjoy the comfort of Power driver 4-way Lumbar Adjust. ",
2015,14-11-2015,4,0.9906,5,I was in the market for a Chrysler 200 but when I could not find one equipped to my liking I took a chance on test driving the 500L and never looked back. ,
2015,01-12-2015,4,0.7227,4, I bought my Fiat new in 2014. I have had it ever since and it now has 30200 miles. I have had no problems with the car. It has been wonderful for gas mileage easy to drive and park.,
2015,26-12-2015,4,0.4019,1,Hard to think of any that would make the car noticeably better.,
2015,26-12-2015,4,0.3612,1,THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER .... DO NOT BUY FIAT,
2015,16-10-2016,4,-0.7034,5,New electronic instrument cluster intuitive clutch and shifter very good brakes extremely fun to drive.,
2015,15-12-2016,4,0.7774,5, I bought my Fiat 1 year ago. I love the little car! But Fiat is not customer friendly. On 8/27/2015 my engine blew with 28000 on the car. It took over a month to get it repaired and back to me. Three days later I gave it back to the dealer as it was not fixed. The 2nd engine blew. 3 months later they gave me my car back. The upper management will not contact me. They continue to tell a CSR my options. 1/3 of my ownership has been in the shop and they don't care. Buyers look elsewhere if you want support. My case number is 28015096.,
2016,15-02-2016,1,0.5478,5, For the first time ever I had to give a car a name. Meet Donatella who sat in the showroom with the shiny white and chrome finish the huge sunroof open to let the light show off the tobacco leather interior and then the moves of the effortless 2.5L and taught starring and ride sold me. However that same day in a quad-fecta of Midtown Manhattan I drove and bargained for the Q3 X1 Countryman 500X and then before buying the next day I threw in the ringer of the HR-V. Over some tense deliberations at Dunkin Donughts the spouse and I agreed to throw out logic and get the Fiat. Yes we've been back to the dealer for squeaky breaks and a blown fuse for the locks  but Fiat of Manhattan has been nothing but professional and accomodating with walk-in Saturday service. I've enjoyed nice lunches in Midtown and walks in Central Park and I knew very well that except for the HR-V we'd see the dealer again.,
2016,29-02-2016,1,0.9272,5, I purchased this car for my wife's daily use.  She loves it.  We have owned it for 6 months and have had zero problems.   She gets a lot of positive comments on the car.  It seems well put together is quite on the highway and it has good forward visibility and lighting.  Overall a good blend of styling and technology.,
2016,30-03-2016,1,0.91,5, got this fiat 500x  on Feb 24 2016   it seams to be a good little SUV .   so far NO problems.   have about 2500 miles on it now.,
2016,01-02-2017,1,-0.5065,5, The new 2017 500C Pop is the same as the 2016 500C Easy.  I ended up purchasing the 2016 Easy because there was one in a color I liked at the closest dealership.  This model is an extremely affordable way to have a convertible manual transmission cruise control great climate control and bluetooth (U connect is super user friendly I've never had a vehicle with bluetooth and started using it the day I bought the car).  I have enjoyed shifting gears in my 500C IMMENSELY and I'm sure the experience is similar in the 2017 Pop.  I honestly don't miss all the extras the lounge offers because I'm not a fan of leather seats (freezing in the winter when I leave for work around 6:20 A.M.).  I also love the simple knobs for A/C and heat as well as the interior air filter etc.  The design of the interior is simple and intuitive.  Plus the 500C offers the best of both world in practicality and owning a convertible.,
2016,27-04-2016,2,0.9892,5, My Fiat 500x has been named Bambino.  Awesome drive great shifting acceleration (especially sport mode).  I wish they had put a/c vents in the rear and a spare tire.  But beyond that the faux leather is amazing the sound system is great the gas mileage is so-so but you'll love this vehicle.  The trunk is split so you have reserved space the rear seats are roomy (I have three kids back there everyday).  We sold our Sienna for this vehicle and NO REGRETS.  It never feels like its dying during acceleration and its terribly unique and adorable.  The sun roofs are lovely and the technology is perfect (USB AUX SATELLITE- no cd). I've read reviews where they say the car feels like it can't find the right gear that is total nonsense the moment you own your vehicle you figure out the gears and how they feel 9 speed-it does what it's supposed too.  I tried MANY brands (for months) before taking Bambino and I almost bought another vehicle.  I feel blessed I tried Fiat.  After two test drives the same day...I was sold! Definitely an underdog.  Deserves hand washes and premium.,
2016,28-04-2016,2,0.9716,1, DO NOT BUY THE FIAT 500e!!  There is a major design flaw that will cost you $2000 at least once and likely $2000 / year.  This is NOT covered by the warranty.  Before buying one take a look at the plug (where the gas cap would normally be).  It is very fragile plastic.  Now think that for 8 hours or more a day this will be plugged into a charger with a handle slightly smaller than a gas pump handle.  Now think that if a small child bumps that even once the plastic connector will snap.  That simple looking connector costs almost $2000 to replace.  It is part of a cable bundle that runs to the front of the car.  It takes 7 hours to replace (at least that's what they bill).  This will break!!  Beware before buying this car!!  Warranty will not cover it because they say it is the child's fault for bumping into it not a car problem.,
2016,27-05-2016,2,-0.3839,5,I was used to a subura crosstrak  but after a wreck  couldnt afford another subura .  this is almost the same .,
2016,20-06-2016,2,-0.5927,5, Great little car for short distance commute and travel. Has plenty of space in the backseat even though trunk space is limited. Charging is easy but know that on standard 110V outlet it would take an entire day to charge up. 24V commercial chargers can do the same in 4 hours or you can install a 240V at home. Love the styling and it's a hoot to drive. Instant torque and no shifting makes the car feel like it has way more power than it does. No problem at all passing cars with easy and it handles very well. Slightly wobbly on highway with high wind. One of the best EV out there that drives handles and performance as good with any gasoline vehicle - 500E is better than any other 500 variant including the Abarth IMO.,
2016,04-04-2017,2,0.9785,4," Here's the thing--there are a lot of cars with more room better build quality more cache better reliability and more room. There are cars that have way more updated electronics navigation etc. and are more functional in terms of rear seat space ergonomics and the like. None of them will be more fun than this car. None of them will make you smile laugh look forward to driving them talk to people about them or write a review. The Abarth (mine is a 2016 automatic in yellow) puts fun first and functionality second but don't take that to mean it's a toy or not a good everyday car. The automatic is a hoot (I own three other stick shift cars including a Porsche 911 in NYC) and blips the throttle with a roarty exhaust backfire when you get on the brakes. It pulls hard in point-and-squirt traffic when in ""Sport"" mode (the only mode you should be in) and hugs off-ramps like velcro to wool. It's fun. No one looks twice at your Mini Cooper S or your GTI. I catch people looking at this yellow bee all the time. The amazing thing is how good the ride is. Short wheelbase and stiff springs don't add up to comfort but on the highway and terrible pavement those dual-mode shocks work their magic and it is amazing. Seriously. Front seat space is good visibility is great (a by-product of the high seating position) and when you fold the rear seats down (or delete them) it's like the world's smallest SUV. It's as much car as you want but no more car than you need 94% of the time. Can humans fit in the back? Better than you think...but it's tight. Can I park anywhere? Yes. Do what I did--find a used one with less than 5K miles on it with a full factory warranty let someone else take the depreciation hit and drive off into the sunset. Does the exhaust sound better than a Ferrari? Yes. Is it fast? Not really no. Does it know it? No. It's like the chihuahua who thinks it's a Pit Bull but it's tongue-in-cheek. It's fun. It's probably just what you need.",
2016,25-04-2017,2,0.9924,5,Update:  Our Fiat continues to perform flawlessly.  I love how it drives very nimble and oh so practical.  Still no reliability problems.   Back for routine service (oil changes) only.   Remain puzzled by the continued poor reviews of this car.  I would encourage you to at least look at it and test drive if you are in the market for a small cross-over.,
2016,11-06-2017,2,0.0865,5, Amazing peppiness road handling and comfort.  Unbelievable financing.    I drove a 2013 for 3 years on lease and the dealership gave me such a good deal on a 2017 that I drove it out of the dealership the day I returned my 2013.  The range and mpg-e are better than reported by the EPA.  The 2013 had only one recall and that was a software upgrade.  I have been building and driving EVs for 25 years and this is the best ever excluding Tesla.  Tesla is the best car in the world.,
2016,28-06-2017,2,0.9694,5, I've been a fan Fiats for years mainly because I always thought they were just so cute. When it came around to buying a new car I was more inclined to Fiat because the bang-for-the-buck factor- I tell people that constantly and it's one of the reasons I recommend Fiat so much. How many brand new cars can you get for less than $20k taxes and fees included? Not many. One of my favorite things about my 2016 Fiat 500 Easy is the turning radius. The smaller size of the car combined with the tight-turning ability allows me to make a U-turn in the tightest of spaces with ease. It's zippier than I thought it would be too! I decided against the Sport and Abarth because I don't personally need the extra power (that and it might be tempting) but the acceleration is just fine and SO MUCH FUN. Another one of my favorite features is the space inside- I recently went on a 6-hour road trip with a passenger dog 1 luggage and a dog bed and we all fit wonderfully. Just fold the back seats down and bam you basically have a mini SUV. I'm still surprised at how well this car handles in snow and rain. It's not GREAT in snow but I was pleasantly surprised for how well it did in 2-5 inches. In rain it's fine however I do find going over the large unavoidable puddle to be terrifying because this car is small and light. However it feels good to drive- what I mean is although the car itself feels light in snow and rain it is SOLID. Whether you're driving or in the backseat Fiat's feel like quality vehicles to be in. The interior is beautiful with the houndstooth fabric seats comfortable high quality and durable. Sure the backseat isn't the greatest for comfort as the seats are slightly firm but it's better than you'd think. It's quiet gets great gas mileage and is a smooth ride. My only negatives are that in cold weather it takes a long time to warm up and the blindspot when looking over your shoulder at odd angled intersections is bad. Overall the style the drive price comfort/interior make me love this car so much. I highly recommend.,

2016,07-07-2016,3,0,5, The 500e has a better response than the gas-powered version.  It handles better has the best pickup and go and is so fun to drive.  I wanted to lease an electric vehicle so I wouldn't have to pay for parking in my city's parking meters and garages (my city has an incentive to lease/purchase EVs) especially as I work downtown and must pay to park.  It's a dream to drive and park and recharges when you break so it becomes a game to get as much mileage from a charge as possible.  So far I've had no problems with the car at all.  The lease is up the end of the year and I've become spoiled with having an EV; it's wonderful not to pay for gas oil or smog check!  I hope to continue with either leasing or owning another EV.  At least in California this is the way to go especially as the state has a pay back money incentive to own/lease an EV.,
2016,13-07-2016,3,0.9726,5,I liked the style of it  have been asked several times about it when getting gas and things.,
2016,21-07-2016,3,0.4215,5, I saw an ad on this car early last year and I immediately fell in love. First I was bummed because it wasn't going to be out for a few more months. Finally it came out.... Yay!! I took it out for a few test drives waited for some people to buy it and put out reviews which took forever and still there's hardly any out there. I was scared  because not too many reviews and the ones that were out there were not that good. I've always owned Honda's so I was hesitating test driving other vehicles. I tried the Honda HRV seemed very cheap to me. So I kept searching the inventory for my little fiat I wanted a white lounge model with black leather seats and a sunroof they had them within 50 miles of me but by the time I got more serious about finally going and getting it of course they didn't have any within 200 miles of me that had the sunroof... So mine doesn't have the sunroof but that's ok I was kind of worried about the mesh that's up there any ways because the sunlight comes in the car a little too much the lady I spoke to at one the dealer's said you could tint the sunroof but I also thought that the mesh will eventually deteriorate......Anyhow I got a fantastic deal on mine.... And I Love Love Love it!! I think I will name it Marshmallow My 20 year old daughter's idea. I've had my baby since February and I haven't had any real issues with it. The one thing is when you lock the doors with the button outside sometimes you have to press it a few times. The transmission is a little tetchy and not real quick off the line that's ok I guess Fewer tickets... I was worried it wouldn't get up hills very good but it does just fine.  The seats are super comfortable. And like another reviewer mentioned is the cool gas cap there isn't one yay! You just open the door and boom you stick the nozzle in and you can't just stick any thing in there either so you don't have to worry people will still your gas..... I was on the fence about this car (even though I really wanted it) I was worried because it's a Fiat and not a Honda but now everyday I go outside and see my little baby I'm so glad I got it.,
2016,21-07-2016,3,0.9914,5,Very stylish! ( A cross between a Mini Cooper and a CRV),
2016,23-07-2016,3,0,5,"I've never had a car that got so many looks. We are often pointed out as being the ""blue pill car"" people look at it in passing and point take pictures. I'm a star at the Whole Foods parking lot. I got followed to another gourmet food place in Redhook by a lady who came up to tell me she knew to follow the Fiat as that type of car would know where to go. The guy at my local car wash asked if the interior was custom! ",
2016,05-08-2016,3,0,5," I continue to be amazed by the relatively poor reviews given to this car by the ""experts"".  We have had ours for 1 1/2 years now and continue to find it a quality car with excellent driving characteristics and versatility.   Give it a chance and you will love it.   I know people have concerns about Fiat reliability.  All I can say is that since we bought it we have been back to the dealer just once for routine oil change.",
2016,11-08-2016,3,0.875,4,Small but not too small.,
2016,25-08-2016,3,0,5, I love my car. I drove several different cross-overs and loved this one. I asked for a longer factory warranty and got it--89 months/100000 miles. I have had no problems with my car and drive it daily.,
2016,10-09-2016,3,0.6369,4," Only had our 500X AWD for a month but it seems to handle the curves in the mountains of NC/TN very well. Also the AWD seems to handle the rain better than our FWD Corolla. Notice some reviews complain on the shifting my experience switch to ""sport"" when you know you need more responsive shifting. Works for us. Not really comfortable front seats but for a compact SUV I can live with it. Only real complaint is the factory navigation and trying to find an update for it online. Google maps very up to date but would like NAV to be updated so I can leave phone alone totally and use factory hands free. Look forward to this fall/winter to see how the AWD holds up.",
2016,30-09-2016,3,0.9428,5," I bought this car because 95% of my driving is short range for shopping post office etc. when I am not traveling out of the country for business.  Also - the dealer and government incentives made the lease price so low the car was essentially free - the lease is about the amount I paid for gas monthly.   I truly did not expect to fall in love with this little car!   It makes me smile every time I drive it.  It is amazingly quiet and solid and very quick.  You really need to watch your speed.  It brakes very well and also handles better than expected considering it has hundreds of pounds of batteries in the floor. Whenever someone new gets in the first thing they say is ""Wow - it's nice!  And it's roomier inside than I expected!""  It is usually just me and a dog or the two of us but we have had 4 people in the car to go a short way to dinner etc.   The fact that there is NO SOUND except the (excellent) radio turning on when you ""start"" it still takes some getting used to.  The seats are surprisingly comfortable considering that they are so small and thin.  Totally adequate for the car.  The sound system is better than my Acura's.  The NAV is a simple TomTom system but it works and it has nearby charging stations pre-programmed in.  The Bluetooth works perfectly as does the climate control system.  This little car really is well equipped with everything except a backup camera but the rear bumper is about 10"" behind the rear window so it isn't a  serious issue and it has the parking sensors anyway.    Yes there are a few little ergonomic issues about the car that frustrate me and the steering requires real attention on the freeway  but in general for what it is intended for this is what everyone should be driving around town.    I have owned around 50 cars and this will be the one that will be hardest to let go of.   GREAT WORK FIAT!  And thanks to Fiat of Glendale for making the purchase so easy.",
2016,08-11-2015,4,0.9925,1,All Wheel Drive at a good starting price (around $24K),
2016,28-12-2015,4,0.4404,5,it rides good   easy to get in and out since it doesn't sit low  .   ,
2016,06-10-2016,4,0.7659,4," I like the way the car drives but dislike a lot of the interior features.  First off the performance is great and I've never had such a fun car to drive.  The acceleration sets you back in your seat and is instantaneous.   I don't mind the range as we kept our gas cars and 95% of our driving is local.  The charging has been fine with the standard 110 outlet and I don't see a need for the fast charger.  My 7 year old daughter fits in the rear seat without a problem but I'm happy the lease will be up in a few years as we'll run out of room as she grows.  As for the bad....Headroom is awful.  I'm 6'3"" and basically have to put my head into the sunroof area to drive.  Backing out of a driveway is difficult as the rear visibility is very poor.  I'm happy for the sensors.  Storage inside the car is also horrible.  The glove box interior is flat so all your stuff comes out when you open the door.  The cupholders are too close together for even 2 medium drinks.  There's nowhere to put a cell phone.  I hate the radio.  There's a navigation warning that comes on for a while that prevents you from changing the channel...unless you take your eyes off the road and hit the ""accept"" button twice.  I don't need navigation as my cell phone does it better.  The Satellite Radio sounds compressed and worse than a cassette tape.  There's no CD player.  I love audio and honestly can't speak to the quality of the speakers since broadcast radio is the best quality thing I've listened to.  I hate that every statistic is listed in MPGe but we fill the car in kilowatts.  I find MPGe to be a worthless number.  One cool feature about the car is the smartphone app that allows me to turn on the climate control before I get to the car.  It's just tough that it only turns on the last setting you had.  If I drove with the air off and the windows down I have to remember to turn it back to automatic 68 degrees when I park if I want to use the app.    I also love/hate the App's function to show where the car is because it allows the person with whom you share the car with to spy on you.  I have nothing to hide but it gets weird when the other person knows where you went out for lunch.  The regenerative braking is cool but it doesn't seem to activate fully until the car is less than 90% charged.  i.e. It will regenerate up to -10kw but after 89% battery remaining it will go up to -40kw regeneration.  It almost pays not to fully charge the car if you don't need the range.    There's also a weird spot between 5mph and 0 where the brakes engage differently and grip strongly into a forceful stop.   Overall I like the car as a car but don't like the comfort features.  I'll miss it when the lease is up because it is such a unique experience.",
2016,14-10-2016,4,0.7719,5,I feel for the previous reviewers on here. I knew going into a new build from two manufacturers not know for reliability that there would be issues but that was the same for BMW/Mini and Audi. I read up on the USA 500xmweb forum and most known issues have bulletins on the faults. I randomly joined an Italian FB group and they go bonkers over the car but also have some similar issues. I don't need a daily driver and honestly if the dealer keeps it overnight for some time I'd just take the subway home and not have to worry about parking. I'd not recommend anything but a Honda/Mazda/Kia/Toyota as a daily driver but I've had those too over the years and frankly I'm really enjoying the sense of occasion I'm getting with the Fiat. I just really enjoy Donatella's company even when she's having an off day.,
2016,26-10-2016,4,0.9016,5,Easy to drive and easy to park,
2016,29-10-2016,4,0.7003,5, Got a great offer on a lease with the 500X and I'm glad we took advantage of it. So far with a couple highway trips and a lot of downtown driving we are very hoppy with the car. The only complaint I can come up with is the way the trim levels are structured but between the nice interior that is way more subtle and stylish than it's Jeep counterpart the ease of driving and the driving position in the vehicle we are very satisfied.,
2016,28-11-2016,4,0.9386,5," I was looking for a car after a deer totaled my beloved Prius.  Because we're moving to the country and it's West Virginia an AWD was high on the list of must haves.  Went to the dealership intending to look at Imprezas.  When we got to the lot we saw the 2 Imprezas on my list and then noticed this little darling tucked in the corner with AWD on the windshield.  At first we both chuckled then walked up for a closer look.  It was pretty much love at first sight!  The car is charming both exterior and interior.  Got the keys got in and said ""Wow these seats are comfortable!""  Took it for a spin both in town and on the highway and was pleasantly surprised at how nimble it is to drive comfort was great and speed -- let's just say this car has pickup!!  It was so smooth on the highway my husband said ""honey you're going to have to watch your speed in this.""  Went back to the dealership to check out the Imprezas (since that's what we went for) sat in one and immediately got out.  Didn't even take it out of the parking spot.  Walked back in asked for the Fiat 500x Easy keys back and drove it home that day.  The drive home was 2 hours and I loved every minute of it.  My husband drove it all the next while we ran errands and said if he was in the market for a car he'd look for one for himself.  No it doesn't get the same gas milage as the Prius but Prius doesn't make an AWD and that was more important to me this time.  Bought it used 2016 10000 miles on it not one scratch or stain -- perfect contdition.  I love love love this car!!!!  Give it a try you won't regret it!!!!",
2016,04-12-2016,4,0.9942,4,For particulars I find the transmission unnoticeable for the most part. When I want to notice I'm rather impressed with the execution but do thing it's a little over the top for such a vehicle. The engine is smooth smooth smooth and pleanty powerful. Donatella does like to drink in the city at 19mpg but does take it easy on the N.J. Turnpike at 30mpg with cruise mostly set at 75 um 79mph. Uconnct works very well and so much easier than the BMW/Mini system as it shows as much love for my Android as it does for my Apple phones. The dog seems happy with the back seat. The sunroof is a huge favorite and the fixed glass part over the back seat opens that space up tremendously compared to all but the X1. ,
2016,22-12-2016,4,0.9912,4, Spouse and I found ourselves in a rush and needing a rental car.  The only car immediately available was a Fiat 500 with automatic.  We took it.  On a 100 mile road trip to the event venue the car proved to be more than adequate to the task.  While acceleration was slow once at speed the car maintained interstate speeds without trouble.  We drove 80 and even 85mph passing many more powerful cars.  If you know how to drive a small engine this thing will do the job.  It was comfortable for two and luggage space was adequate for a long weekend trip.,
2017,05-02-2017,1,0.9002,5, I'm a little biased to the Fiat brand having owned a 128 Sport Coupe in the 70's and currently a 2012 500 Abarth. The 500x was something I wanted but had to do a little arm twisting to get my wife on board. We traded her Jeep Wrangler Sport in and I believe we were both happy to say goodbye to what was probably the most uncomfortable vehicle we've owned. We've sacrificed a little space moving into the 500x but aside from that we really love this vehicle. The ride is really comfortable handling is precise acceleration is adequate and it's a treat to drive. That's one thing about my Fiats that set them apart from all the other vehicles we've owned. Plain and simple they are fun to drive!,
2017,03-03-2017,1,0.9766,5," I moved into the 500x Trekking AWD from my 2013 FIAT Abarth. I really really liked my Abarth but absolutely love my new 500x! I have some physical disabilities and the Abarth was while very fun to drive also hard for me to drive and was starting to find that people just do not see you in that small of a vehicle. Looking for comfort and size over the Abarth and the high quality of a precision Italian SUV boy did I find it! The new interior of the 500x Trekking is amazing and the technology in the features blew me away! It may take me a month to learn how to use everything this SUV has to offer. Styling is great and the optional 18"" wheel package and AWD I got adds even more tremendous styling. Acceleration is so so but then again I'm coming from the Abarth. Fuel economy is also not real fantastic but still pretty reasonable. Overall I have zero complaints on this SUV. The one serious recommendation I have though is get either the Trekking AWD or Lounge AWD model. I test drove the Pop and Easy FWD models and they do not even compare. All the bells and whistles with the two higher models are 100% worth it!",
2017,16-03-2017,1,0.9868,5," 2017 Fiat Spider 124 Abarth manual with brembo brake pkg.  It is such a joy to drive.  Handles fantastic beautiful interior beautiful looking car outside and inside. Love the hood and design of the car.  I owned a 95' 325I for about 9 years (very good car) and a 2006 330I for about 2 years.  The 330I cost a lot of money in repairs.  I wanted to purchase a 2014 Cayman S but the price of admission for a nicely optioned used one is about $50000.  I test drove the Fiat Spider and for $31700 brand new it was a no brainer.  Plus the Spider comes with 4 year 50000 warranty vs 3 year 36000 for the Miata.  I still would like to get a Cayman someday (but would like to keep the Spider as a second car) but for now I couldn't be happier with my decision.  I look forward to driving the car everyday.  I'm 6' 1"" and fit comfortably but it would be nice to have about 1 more inch of room so I could get the seat back a bit further ( I also wish the Cayman seat went back about one inch further).  That's why I gave it a 4 star out of 5 for comfort. I test drove the Fiat and then went and test drove the Miata the same day.  The Mazda Club with brembo brakes you can get for about $30000 and the Spider Abarth is about $31700 plus tax.  You can't go wrong with either car.  I believe the Mazda handles a little better and is a bit faster.  But for my everyday driving the Spider is just perfect.  It just came down to personal taste.  The clincher being Japanese build quality with Italian styling.  I like the alcantara seat fabric and the Recaro seats.  Plus the quad tail pipes.  They sound great in 1st and second gear but I wish they were louder as you go through the gears.  I love both cars but just liked the looks a little better of the Spider.  If you want wheel locks so some clown doesn't steel your wheels you can get them from the Mazda parts dept. for about $59 or order them online from Good-Win-Racing.com part ", 61-1057F for about $99.00.  After reading the comments about the goodwinracing wheel locks I opted for those.  Don't think you can go wrong either choice.  Happy motoring.  And do your self a huge favor regardless of what your wife or parents or friends say make sure you get the manual...  Shifting gears is half the fun of owning the car.
2017,28-04-2017,2,0.9972,5,Only caveat is that if you're more than 6' tall or over 200lbs definitely spend some extended time in one before committing to the purchase as it is a tight fit.,
2017,09-05-2017,2,0.6705,5, Makes going to the physical therapist - lower back - fun. Fortunately it comes with a walker :). Love the car. A kick to drive. Got the 6 speed. Comfortable. Handles very well. Grand children love it; kids are jealous. Wife who swore she wouldn't get in it when I drove on a highway has recanted and loves it too. Everything I had hoped for... and more.,
2017,09-06-2017,2,0.9711,5, I have been gagging for this car since Fiat/ Mazda bought it to my attention. It has taken me months to drill down and get the car I wanted. All I ever found on my search was automatics!!! ( I love driving and the thought of an automatic is just sacrilege in my opinion) Of course it had to be red and I opted for the luxury package which is totally worth it especially the LED lights and their capacity to light the road ahead at night. Just outstanding. Its GORGEOUS from every angle. Driving it is a pleasure. Love the torque and relaxed nature of the engine. Would prefer the exhaust a little louder (I have the 500 Abarth and its a mean sounding just beautiful chorus which is subdued in the 124) Was surprised Fiat didn't option it with the flat bottomed steering wheel that they have in the 500 which is a tactile pleasure but none the less it does feel good in the hands along with the shifter and short throws. Italian cars really do it for me they connect me emotionally which is lacking in other cars. Mazda and Fiat have done a wonderful job and I hope it pays big dividends for them.,
2017,12-06-2017,2,0.986,5, If your idea of performance is based on quarter mile times this isn't the car for you. If on the other hand carving through canyon or mountain roads is your thing there may not be anything else on sale at any price that can put as big a grin on your face as this Fiat. Its suspension is better sorted than the MX-5 (less roll less bumping up against the bump stops) and it has all the power you can realistically use on public roads. It also looks - to my eyes anyway - a more mature / elegant design than the Mazda. This is my third Fiat and - despite the reputation - I've never had a problem with any of them.,
2017,13-06-2017,2,0.9511,5, I've owned a couple of 2-seat roadsters...a 2004 Porsche Boxster and my 2017 Fiat 124 Spider Abarth.  The Boxster at close to $60000 was one of the best pure driver's cars I've ever driven.  That said for half the price of the Porsche I get 95% of the driving fun with my Abarth Spider.  I've had the car for about 6 months now...it was one of the first Abarths delivered in my area.  So far with almost 5000 miles on it it has been pure enjoyment.  Since neither my wife nor I are particularly large people we find the cockpit of the Abarth more than comfortable even on long rides.  The fit and finish is beautiful...ours is pearl white with the black leather interior...it turns heads wherever we go.  I've had many people ask what the car was and have gotten nothing but compliments from everyone.  I'm really glad we got the Abarth...the upgrades are worth it and make all the driving difference.  The Abarth's quad exhaust has a much nicer note than the Lusso or Classica.  Not that they are bad...just a bit quieter than I like.  The biggest difference is the Sport mode selector on the automatic transmission.  Since my wife opted for the auto the paddle shifters on the Abarth are a good compromise.  Also in Sport mode the shifts are much sharper and responsive.  Overall this car is a winner for us...great looking fun to drive and a great value for the money.  If you're in the market for a great 2-seat roadster give this one a long look...odds are you won't be disappointed!,
2017,19-06-2017,2,0.9951,5, First off this car is 75 to 80% Mazda Miata. However the similarity ends there. The car has a longer nose and much better styling in my opinion.  The Fiat sounds and feels like a sports car.  The 6 speed auto is a Aisen product which gives the car the ability to shift even faster than a 6 speed manual.  To be fair the 6 speed auto is enough if you travel the daily freeway commute like me. While I have had the car for less than a week my sportscar past is not nill.  My father owned a 1988 Mazda RX7 convertible. While the RX7 could take a corner without effort  the Fiat still does the same but is a bit nose heavy. Why? The Fiat's engine is an iron block placing more weight over the front wheels.  Yet  the car takes the corners well.  I am still enjoying my commute even though I had to give up a Prius Plug-in that gets 50-60 mpg and a free ride in the CA HOV lane.  Who cares really when the Fiat is much more fun to drive and gets 31mpg on average.  It's your call but why waste money on a more expensive BMW or Mercedes when you can get an excellent roadster out of the Fiat 124 Spider Lusso.,
2017,26-06-2017,2,0.9775,5, I have owned over 65 vehicle in my lifetime and this 500X hits a sweet spot between form and function. It has that either love it or hate it styling ..which I love...the driving experience with the manual 6 speed and turbo 1.4 gives that sense of control and feel for the road that seems missing in most of the made for the masses CUV's out there...its refreshing to be engaged with the driving experience instead being a slave to the computer controlled automatic transmissions that make a mad dash for the highest ratio gearing no matter what speed you are driving. I guess I am one of the 4% ers that still like to row their own gears in this style of vehicle.                   The great part of this vehicle is that it has a 4 year/50K bumper to bumper warranty for a car that is priced with incentives at $15K .  Add to that fact that the car is well executed in its fit and finish with better quality materials than what would be found on higher grade trim levels from other manufacturers you can drive away from the dealership confident that you are not feeling car poor and still are driving a car that might arouse some envy from onlookers. ......time will tell if the thrill of commanding a fun to drive stylish CUV will fade but I suspect given the choice of driving my RAV4 limited or the 500X in my driveway I will grab the keys to the FIAT....she is just so much more fun!,
2017,04-08-2016,3,0.9133,5, Such a drop-dead gorgeous car.  I was immediately won over by its styling.  Handling is impeccable and ample torque makes it really fun to drive.,
2017,08-08-2016,3,0.9061,5," Realizing that a two seat roadster isn't for everyone if you enjoy driving or would like to enjoy it and have the luxury of being able to get by with just two seats the FIAT 124 Spider is a great choice. Unless you just don't like driving the FIAT Spider is sure to put a smile on your face and make you want to take the long way to wherever you're going. This car isn't a super-powered muscle car but is light weight nimble peppy and handles superbly. While beauty is in the eye of the beholder for me this car is gorgeous. Many sports cars are known for their harsh ride - not the FIAT. While providing great sporting performance it also has a very comfortable and enjoyable ride with the top up or down. I'm 5'-8"" and the car fits me very well. I can imagine that someone over six-foot would feel a bit tight. I test drove both the automatic and the manual and concluded that while both are really great the manual provides an edge higher level of driver engagement and driving pleasure. But upon the insistence of my wife I purchased the auto. While I enjoyed the manual I'm very pleased with the auto. It's great cruising on the open road where you're not shifting a lot anyway and it's also less of a hassle in city traffic. I couldn't be more satisfied.",
2017,05-09-2016,3,0.9971,5," Until August 2 2016 I was ready to buy a 2017 Mercedes SLC300 via European delivery. Then I realized that I'd be paying $55K in advance for a car that wouldn't be in my home driveway for 6 months or more. Just to be sure I was making the right choice i googled ""2017 convertibles"" and suddenly saw a pic of a car I'd never seen before.  Having done a test drive in a Mercedes I was impressed with the quiet ride at 70mph on a freeway with top down. I was able to converse with the salesman at normal volume. One thing that totally UN-impressed me was that to start the newest Mercedes you MUST put a key in the ignition!  Within 48 hours of my Mercedes test drive I was cruising in a 2017 Fiat 124 Spider which seemed just as quiet on the highway and has push-button start. When I started comparing the overall specs of both cars the new body styling of the 124 Spider and at HALF the price of the Mercedes it became a VERY easy decision. As the former owner of 2 Porsche Lotus Esprit 3 Mercedes SL convertibles and a Rolls after a month driving my new 2017 Spider I am VERY happy with my choice!",
2017,10-10-2016,4,0.9592,5," MANY Cars in my life..  But THIS CAR..  Is my Sweetest One Yet !!....  Many Loud Fast V8 Sticks...  At 54 they've started to get on my nerves.. Selling my Mustang GT now since I bought this Car...  Old Roommate in the 80's had a 124 Spider that I borrowed ALL THE TIME Cuz I LOVED IT !!...  When they announced the Partnership of Fiat / Mazda actually producing a NEW 124..  I Immediately  Thought ... ""THAT'S MY NEXT CAR !!!!  .... Italian Looks / Japanese Build Quality TURBO !! Best of Both Worlds... NO REGRETS !!!....   I had to wait 2 months for the Dealer to find my car since ALL of the Lusso's had Auto's..  In a Roadster??...  NO WAY....   Mine is a Lusso Meteor Gray / Black  Every Factory Option with a 6 speed Stick...  The BOSE Stereo System blows me away ...  Almost 900 Miles now.. and STILL...  THEE BEST Most FUNNEST Car I've EVER OWNED !!!!    EVER !!!...  I'd actually Laugh in your face if you wanted to trade me your new Corvette Z06...   =)",

2017,27-10-2016,4,0,5,3 MONTHS LATER ... I now have just over 1000 miles on my FERRARI 124. FIAT owns Ferrari which gave me an idea. I removed or covered ALL the FIAT emblems and now drive the ONE and ONLY car that passes for a Ferrari (yes people believe the emblems they see) but costs about 1/8 the price! I even got a Nevada vanity license plate that says NICECAR so if I pass you in a flash and you see the tag good luck catching me! BOTTOM LINE: Not since my Porsche racing days have I had so much fun behind the wheel of ANY car regardless of the price !!!,
2017,04-11-2016,4,0.9265,5, Just too many good things to write fantastic looks tuff strong cool turbo super power and speed.   Great handling with a attitude loves the road  with the ability to stop.  You just can't not stop looking at the car.  Cool curves angles shape size and style.  The light weight clean lines logical and functional interior adds to the retro mid 60's british sports car feel with a touch of the past.  Buy / Drive/  Ride / Sun in the sky one touch top down enjoy the ride!   Silver 124 Classic 6 speed,
2017,27-11-2016,4,0.9848,5, best car for lonely commute,
2017,30-11-2016,4,0.4019,5, When looking for two seater drop top roadsters that capture the fun of driving a curvy technical back road for a low price you have a choice of a Miata (Mazda MX-5) or a ?. And Mazda does it well with a light weight quick well made and reliable car. But it's styling for me was like the rest of the car superbly functional.  All it needed was some passion to make it perfect and a little tuning by a culture with a rich road racing history.  Along comes Fiat to bring it both.  The beautiful throw back looks of the 124 Sport Abarth added to the MX-5 would have made a great car inspiring and the looks distinctive but it would still not be a Italian sports car but rather a better looking Mazda.  But Fiat ripped the heart out of the Miata by replacing its engine with the soul of an Italian. Now it has it own looks and the totally different driving experience that a turbo charged motor brings to a car.  But what about that tuning?  That is where the Abarth model's unique features come in .  The Bilstein shocks added to the front and rear revised roll stabilizers limited slip differential 17 inch wheels with 205 low profile tires the revised more throaty exhaust that adds four horsepower - combine to allow the engine suspension and even the steering to be dialed in with the sport mode button to transform the 124 from a gentleman's sporting vehicle into a superbly controlled feisty canyon carver expert that blows the top off the fun driving chart. This car feels like it is nailed to the pavement no matter the road surface or the severity of the curves.  Add the Brembo brake option as I did and you can bring down your boiling cup of espresso to a standstill in a heart beat. Put it all together as Fiat has and this is the most fun you can have for a $25 tank of gas that will take you 350 fun (did I mention it was fun?) filled miles..  I have only known her for 1000 miles so far but I can tell you already that if it were possible to marry this car I would.,
2017,10-12-2016,4,0.9751,5," I purchased this Car November 19 2016. Its a base model Lusso with no real upgrades. I have had an extended highway trip and several day trips and I have fallen in love with this car. I owned an 85 Fiat Spider 2000 and I am partial to the Italian styling evident in the body design. Needless to say the performance over the 85 model cannot be compared. The 1.4l turbo accelerates on demand and shifts smoothly up and down. I am using the Asin auto transmission. The road handling and cornering are sharp and responsive. Even so its a smooth highway drive even on long trips. Its not the fastest 0-60 but it is quick. In my opinion the base sound system is adequate for all but the most serious audio enthusiasts. I stream Pandora thru my phone and the sound is terrific once adjusted for treble bass and balance. So my major positives are style and road handling. The only major drawbacks are leg room and trunk space. I am 6'1"" and I can fold my knees into a comfortable driving position but there is not enough room for my big feet. Strangely I have more than enough head room with the top up. If you have big feet there is limited room for the clutch hence my selection of the auto trans. Any over 6'2"" will have difficulty driving this car and they will not fit in the passenger seat due to the trim located where the glove box should be. There is very limited storage space inside the passenger compartment. The trunk has enough room for two small duffel bags and a computer bag. That's fine for my use as a weekender car. Price point for base Lusso is very attractive. In my opinion a lot of the extras in tech package are not necessary or worth the addt expense. Lastly when people see it they will think its a Miata or they ask what it is. Personally I do not think it looks that much like a Miata but there are not many on the road yet so its understandable for mistake. its a great car for those looking for a fun weekender.",
