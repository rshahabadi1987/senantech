1990,13-09-2007,2,0.5042,4.875," The roomy 1990 Honda Civic Wagon had dimensions nearly identical to the current 2011 Honda Fit except the roomy 2011 Honda Fit is much more generous in height at 60"" tall. ",
1990,27-09-2007,2,0,4.25, I had this car as a gift from my Uncle.  He had been using this to drive to work 120 miles a day until I had it 10 years ago where I drove 110 miles a day.  Never had any major problems.  Engine is phenomenal - never been repaired since we got it.  On top of that the engine still sounds like brand new very quiet.  Only bad experience with this car was when I had to push it from a freeway to an exit for a gas it was my fault though - I ran out of gas.  However at an average of 38 miles per gallon with today's gas prices - you'll definitely will try looking for this COLLECTIBLE piece of treasure.  I love this car!,
1990,02-08-2009,2,-0.296,3.75, Great car but made for short people and I'm a tall person. Six foot 1.75 inch people like me really lack in the leg room when driving but it is a nice car. Like the look of the next generation civic more though.,
1990,19-03-2002,3,-0.3566,4.375,Cupholders!!!!,
1990,09-09-2006,3,0.4588,4.375, We bought this car new. That means I've been driving this car for 17 years now and I'm not ready to give it up. Other than needing a new muffler every couple years or so it hasn't need major money output to maintain. I am only just now having the brakes done for the second time. Mileage is wonderful I still get between 32 and 36 mpg. The head gasket has a tiny crack but leak is all but unnoticeable. I just check my oil level and keep it up. It's a manual  and I live in Michigan I have never had major problems driving in winter conditions. The road clearance is very low so I do have to be careful about bottoming out in some situations (it usually gets the muffler.),
1990,20-10-2006,3,0.9738,4.5,my favorite feature on the car is the overall design of it i'm a import tuner guy and there are so many parts you can get for these cars its unreal,

1990,31-12-2006,4,0.6369,4, My car is great it has had a few problems but nothing i couldn't fix myself and for only 5 or ten bucks the car had 200k miles on it when i got now its up to 213k and still running strong it has the original motor in it everything but the seat belts are original its a great car to drive and is very fun ,

1991,28-08-2011,1,0.9113,4.5,I like the contour of the car and the fact that it's a hatchback but still small enough to get great gas mileage.  It's comfortable to sit in and the reduced ground clearance makes it really hug the turns.  I can take a corner at about 25 MPH and it's never left me on the side of the road.,

1991,14-11-2015,3,-0.6683,5, I bought it from a friend of mine who only used it for long trips on the east coast.  It had no rust and under 100 thousand miles on it.  A year later it has 150 thousand miles and still runs strong.  it's fun sporty can carry heavy loads and has never broken down on me.  I had the oil changed at Walmart they never put new oil in it.  I ran it unwittingly for 2 months before I realized the problem and it's never suffered or seized.  My mother had a 1986 Honda Prelude spun it rolled it and still drove it home.  that car died out at 300 thousand miles!  they're easy to fix parts are easy to find and they are exceptionally cheap to maintain.  I've done most of the work on mine myself.,

1991,09-10-2007,4,0.0772,3.75, Bought this thing after it was beat on to crap. Very easy to fix up and modify. Great entry level auto-x ride. Wishbone suspension by far beats the econo macpherson setup of the newer gen.  Stock sohc engine is worthless but again easy to replace and swap out.  Prone to lots of rust with its age. Very little maintanence needed if it's just transportation that you need.  Very light with an engine swap and an adjustable suspension and you have yourself a good sporty car. Parts are interchangeable with integra's which adds to the availability of parts. A lot can be done to the car despite its age.  ,

1992,02-05-2003,1,0.296,4.875, This car is a lot of fun to drive around Chicago.  The light weight the 5-speed manual the 1.5 liter engine and the tight handling make it feel sporty.  Low maintenance.  High MPG.  The body is solid but starting to rust a bit around the rear wheel wells.  After a wash and wax I get offers from random people on the street to buy it.  Just can't bring myself to replace it.  Honda really did this one right.,

1992,16-01-2006,2,0.9548,4.5," Overall a great car. Small yet roomy on the inside. Superb car on the gas! Small engine but w/ 5-speed was able to keep up w/ ""big guys"". I ended my Honda experience being crushed by a tractor-trailer at the stop sign - I am alive but I cannot imagine surviving a real crush ",
1992,29-04-2008,2,-0.9338,5, With fuel the way it is I parked the F 150 crew cab and purchased this vehicle used with 88844 original miles on it.  I have not owned it long but I am already wondering what I ever did with out it.  My first fuel cycle resulted in a MPG of 40.8 mostly highway.  That is a lot better than the 17.5 I was getting.  Now my wife 2 daughters and myself are  all driving Honda's ranging from 92 Civic 02 Accord 04 Accord and 07 Civic.  These have all been great vehicles and I can imagine owning any other make.,
1992,03-08-2011,2,0.6249,4.5,No power and absolutely no pick up over 70 mph especially w/ AC on. All joints are fragile I had to replace shocks and all twice in 4 years police magnet due to fast and furious film fiasco doesn't do well in accidents w/ semi's make sure to replace all belts as schedule or repairs will cost you,
1992,14-09-2012,2,0.296,4, I drove this car until it died. I got the car in 1998 and I got my 350 dollars out of it that I definitely owe Honda some money (Don't tell them that). The car currently has 298000 miles on it. They really don't make cars like that anymore. Sometimes it was really hard to start but always kept me safe. I drove this car from NY to PA TN IN GA SC FL CT OH to name a few places. I loved my car rust and all. The thing is the engine is still alive and kicking .Thing is the car will fall apart but the engine is really built to last. Its just water is coming in now and the alternator has finally died. Bottom line if I could get a semi new 1992 Honda Civic. I would buy it yesterday.,
1992,31-01-2015,2,0.6369,1,better uv protection for windows and paint.  even new civics are just as noisy and engine buzzy.,
1992,26-03-2007,3,0.5267,5,Low maintenance.  High MPG.  So many aspects come together to make it a fun little car for zipping around town.,
1992,08-05-2008,3,-0.3662,4.375,Quick pick up great gas saver ,
1992,21-06-2010,3,0,4.75, I've been tempted to see the car trade it in for anything because the car lasts so long. I am the original owner when it first came out it was the first rounded edge small luxury car. Sure somethings needed replacement: 2 radiators 1 set cv boots 3 alternators 2 ignition coils. Every thing else I could replace myself. I solved the problem of wind noise 14 years later with a rubber band stuffed in the door rubber grommets to press it against the window better and to place some noise insulation underneath the floor and inside the front doors. Get a k & n air filter and pickup from stop is good enough. On the freeway given the light weight at high speed it can match any car from 70+,
1992,28-06-2016,3,0.7468,5,All,
1992,28-12-2004,4,0.9715,4.75,1992  219228 Civics produced 3889 VX    1.77%,
1992,28-11-2005,4,-0.5704,4.5, I bought this car new in 1992 knowing almost nothing about Honda.  I got it because it had 92 hp instead of the paltry 70 the CX and DX had.  It also had cloth seats aluminum wheels and about 5 more mpg.  I planned to sell it when my 1969 Mustang came out of restoration shop but fell in love with the car.  I added the cargo cover cruise control intermittent wipers body side moldings floor mats rear speakers from an SI tinted windows factory clock the tall console with pad which is essential for a comfortable driving position  and AMFM CD with Sirius.  The car is easy to maintain gets about 43 city and 50 hwy.  On one trip to Iowa I filled up the 10 gallon tank in Austin TX and drove to El Dorado Kansas where I put 9.6 gallons in.  That averaged 57.7 mpg driving at 65 mph.  I have never gotten less than 42 mpg and that was in summer AC blasting in city traffic.  I just brought it in to have it rebuilt at 489k.  I will never sell this car.  I painted it once and the interior is still very good.  I wonder how many people have a one owner VX?   I just found out how many were made.,

DOHC engine still very quick and reliable -- cruise very comfortably at fast speeds (would NEVER do with other older-mileage vehicles). Mechanically excellent but some of the interior components starting to deteriorate after 13 years (LED on stereo speakers plastic door handle snapped spring clip for wipers).  Recently test-drove 2003 Civic EX -- difference in performance between 2 was negligible -- I was quite surprised! (Or maybe I couldn't really ""test"" it because salesperson was sitting next to me).

1993,10-03-2009,2,0.9099,4.5, Got car with 150K and unknown maintenance record. Used for commute and some long road trips (1000+ miles) without any problem. Very frugal on fuel and maintenance good brakes decent takeoff good steering and handling seats 4 w/comfort heating/cooling OK good trunk space. The bad: Engine started burning oil at 175K miles. I like mechanics so I did a partial rebuilt (piston rings were worn) and took care of things that mechanics could not (e.g. oil leaks). Cost: about $400 (parts+tools) Car has run great ever since; now at 205K miles gets 25-29mpg in only-city driving and 35-40mpg hwy. We got stranded only once when ignition coil died at 197k miles. Overall I love the car!,

1993,23-06-2003,3,0.9642,4.75,Fuel economy handling sharp shifting (manual trans) even after 205K!!!. Quality: OE radiator lasted 198K miles OE clutch lasted 180K+ miles. Brake cylinder replaced 2k miles ago. Engine trouble came after 175K (which is 11+ years of driving).,
1993,08-11-2005,3,0,4.875," Best econo car ever made and owned so far. Very easy to modify (interior/ exterior wise). I've added a 94 si moonroof rear windshield wiper 17"" rims slightly lowered 99 si dash modification with all red lighting DC5R steering wheel 99 si OEM CD player and slave tape deck better speakers 99 si head lights fog lights 99-00 civic front bumper power door locks/ power windows and it still gets 55+ mpg with the added weight. This car may take a while to pick up speed but is still fast for a super econo engine. So far have had no problems with engine/tranny. A great commuter car. It's a new experience when one drives a car that's nice to your wallet. I'll never get rid of this car!!!",
1993,11-07-2013,3,-0.471,3.875,The wonderful sohc VTEC engine.  This engine is peppy to this day after 13 years of daily driving.  The manual trans. is also pretty sweet very slick good feel.  The seats are alittle stiff but very well shaped and comfy.  This car is quite fun to drive even after 9 years of ownership.,
1993,11-03-2014,3,0,4, I bought my Honda Civic Si in 97' for $6200. I have done some basic performance modifications on it but little to the engine itself. I have had nearly zero problems with this car. My distributor bearing went out in 2001 (cost me approx. $220 to fix myself) and then my ignition coil failed 5/06 (cost me less than $100 to fix myself). This car still gets about  38 mpg on the highway and about 34 mpg in the city. The mpg averages 36-37 even after hitting 260000 miles!! Yes 260000!! This car's little sohs vtec engine is an engineering marvel.  My only complaint is on the body. Nearly every fifth generation Civic (EG) has rust on the rear wheel well. This car has paid for itself 10 times over,

1994,30-07-2012,3,0.6808,4.875, I love my honda i have had it for 6 years and it now has over 465k miles and only have had to do routine maintenance,
1994,01-07-2009,4,0.8367,5, I have had the car for 21years and had little trouble with it. I take good care of it It gets waxed at least once a year. I bought it new for 20100.00,
1994,20-09-2015,4,0.6369,4,and minor things never had a problem. Still runs and drives great has ice cold ac and still shifts and runs just like it did when i got it 6 years ago. I love taking it to the mountains and taking it camping and it has just always been a great family car. I will never trade it in no matter what... i will drive the car till it dies then just install another motor once it does die i always recommend Honda! I love my Honda! ,
1997,11-03-2010,1,0.6249,4.5, I got this car for my 16th birthday three years ago with 88k miles and nearly 30k miles later it's still running great. Had to have the axle replaced a while back for a cost of $800 but that's really been the only problem I've had. Gas mileage is decent but could be a little better. Acceleration can be a tad sluggish but overall okay for a 4 cyl. Couldn't have asked for a better first car.,
1997,19-03-2013,1,0.6908,2.875,Slow acceleration especially up hills gas mileage is not exceptional. The gas gauge isn't steadymaking it hard to tell exactly how much gas you have.,
1997,18-03-2016,1,0.0762,5, This was my first car. I bought it when I was 16 and kept for 9 years and simply needed a change. This is a car for anyone be it your first car a project car or a commuter car. By no means was the car fast but it took corners like it was on rails and it was very lively; especially compared to V6/V8 Toyota/Lexus that my parents own. My only grip was the placement of the cup holders. To access them you would have to open a flap which in turn covered the slot to the CD/tape player. Great car to blast around a track and the best part was I still got solid gas mileage regardless of how aggressively I drove. Very easy/cheap to repair own and soup up. Very sad that Honda doesn't make their cars like this anymore.,
1997,21-03-2016,1,0.5605,5,Sunroof controls to the left of the steering wheel solid build quality sporty feel great sound system quality.,
1997,30-05-2004,2,0.6433,4.75,I enjoyed everything about this car.This car was fun to drive and great on gas.Over the years I had this car never never had to put more than $150 for repairs. Yes i did get breaks but that normal other than that is was a wonderful car. Great Job Honda,
1997,14-01-2007,2,0.9517,5, I bought this car as my first car from a private seller for $1400 with 146K on it only 3 months ago. When I first bought it it needed a new oil distributor and radiator. I replaced them both thinking I had gotten away with an awesome deal. Then one of my tires went flat spent a pretty penny on that too. Shortly after on a long trip to my favorite state park the transmission gives out in the middle of the road when I was almost at my destination. I had invested too much money on repairing this car for it not to last and I would never buy it used again. For the short while it lasted though gas mileage was AMAZING.,
1997,18-05-2010,2,0.9416,5, I think buying a honda you will never go wrong. I bought mine in 1998 and trade it in 2005 just because i wanted something bigger living in the north. I wish I would have kept my civic ex,

2003,09-01-2007,1,0.501,5,I wish the car had more storage space behind the third row seat! Ceiling heat/AC vents would be great for the second and third row occupants (like the Odessey has). Make a hybrid or improve MPG please.,
2003,16-01-2007,1,0.8968,3.875,The midsize of this SUV!  It is big enough to handle most of our needs but not as big as the huge SUVs (Chevy Suburbans GMC Yukons Ford Expeditions etc.) that are seen often being driven by a parent with 1-2 kids. ,
2003,18-01-2010,1,0.6486,4.75," We bought our 2003 Honda new and have close to 200000 miles on the car.  It is still going strong and we've had no problems. We have done all of the recommended maintenance as outlined in the Honda owners manual (oil changes brakes engine tune ups etc.) The car has been great in the snow and with good tire tread(all season radials) we have had NO problems thus far.  Reliability has been exceptional.  The interior has held up fairly well after the wear and tear of three kids.  Our oldest child is now driving and this car will probably be driven ""into the ground"" by her.  Our experience has been so good that we are looking at the 2010 Pilot! Overall we're happy with our Honda Pilot!",

2003,27-08-2010,2,0.5562,4, Bought certified pre-owned in 2005 with 30K miles. Bought extended warranty. Paid off last month and warranty ran out 8-9-2010 trans failed 8-23-2010. No help from warranty but Honda paid 25%. Picked up today and drove 1/4 mile and it made a grinding noise with ABS and VTM lights coming on. Waiting on Monday. All dealer service since purchased.,

2003,05-07-2010,3,0.3382,4.875, I live in the mountains of NC. The roads are very dangerous here esp. in the winter. I test drove my Pilot in a snow storm and bought it for its size and great gas mileage. i Never got stuck in the snow. and i drove this past winter for an hour from boone to beech mountain Everyday. nothing and i mean nothing ever went wrong in the car. the only things i spent money on were literally break pads and a few oil changes. it was at 125k when i recently hit a deer going 70mph and its now totaled and im now heartbroken. there seems to be something seriously wrong with every SUV i consider to replace my pilot with. i loved luxury cars but now im feeling more sensible... and a grille guard is ness,
2003,01-10-2010,3,0.7269,4.625,None! The Pilot does everything an SUV needs to do and does it well. ,
2003,13-10-2010,3,0,3.625, My husband bought me a 2003 Honda Pilot EXL for Mother's day. We had just had a baby and I was driving a 2002 Mustang and needed something I felt would be safer. We had no major problems. The engine mounts had to be replaced and the transmission was beginning to act a little squirrelly. However my husband wrecked it before we were able to get the transmission checked out. He fell asleep behind the wheel on the way home from work (oil field) and went off into a steep ditch hitting a concrete embankment which caused the Pilot to roll twice landing upside down when finished. My husband was not buckled and ended up in the back by the cargo door. He WALKED away with NO INJURIES. Thank you Honda!,

2003,06-02-2014,3,0,5,It would be nice to buy a new car but just can't let go of it to see how far it'll go!,
2003,01-05-2014,3,0.8807,5, My wife always liked her pilot better than my RX300. Both are 2003. I traded my lexus after 10 years ln 2013 for a Camry Hybrid as we no longer need 2 SUV's in the family and she didn't want to give up her Pilot. We have spent little or no additional money on the car and it now has 111000 miles and going strong. I have to say this car is a good buy. She still doesn't want to trade it but we've been looking for new car that has an automatic lift gate for her. Maybe now?,
2003,22-10-2015,3,0,5,After 200000 miles in ten reliable years I must say that it has been a pleasure owning it.,
2003,04-01-2007,4,0.906,4.5, Great family vehicle.  Comfortable ride and handling (after replacing OEM tires).  Good ergonomics for a big man.        ,

Easy to drive with better than most visability. Long lasting. No problems. Bought it at Malkoon Motors. Good place to buy a used car.,
2003,29-05-2014,4,0.3182,4.5, I brought home my first born from the hospital in my new Honda Pilot.,
2004,01-01-2007,1,0.604,5, My Honda pilot has never let me down it's good in the rain in the snow gets me were ever I have to go .  It's very comfortable and wants to cruise control is set on the open road I have to do very little except for stay awake and steer .  Honda has been very good at doing all the recalls and their service is excellent .,
2004,16-06-2010,1,0.4404,3.75, Very happy with the pilot have owned it for 6 months we have had a strange noise coming from under the vehicle almost sounds like the cooling fans just take off at a very high speed and stop. And the suspension has a issue with hopping sometimes. Have brought back to the dealership 3 times and the truck won't make the noise nor will it act up at all. Thinking about asking for them to take the truck back if they can not find the problem. We really like this vehicle its a good solid SUV.,
2004,05-10-2010,1,0.9746,4.875,Comfy ride especially on long trips convenient center console storage,

2004,09-01-2013,1,0.8805,4.125,The room in the interior and the comfort its a heavy SUV so you get a nice ride and we pull a pop up camper and there is no problems.,
2004,16-08-2016,1,0.9603,5,Car is underpowered for its size especially when fully loaded with passengers and/or cargo but we handle this aspect by just driving more conservatively. Fuel economy is not great but that's not unexpected for a full size SUV with 4x4 capacity. We really don't' have any complaints beyond this.  We are very happy with it as a family and roadtrip vehicle.  ,

2004,29-04-2015,2,0.9326,4.75, The car has a smooth ride and road noise is minimal on highway. We added a hitch and roof rack and with 6 adults and loaded with cargo the car handles quite nicely except that it is  underpowered especially if it's fully loaded. Acceleration and hill climbs are slower than I would like. This car has a lot of cargo space with room for car seats in 2nd and 3rd rows though access to 3rd row can be a bit challenging for an average adult. 3rd row is best for kids or small adults as legroom is limited. We are happy with this car. Great family or roadtrip vehicle.  It's held its value well and we will be holding on to it for a long time.,
2004,04-04-2016,2,0.34,5, We love our Honda Pilot... We live in Colorado along the I25 corridor and this car is subjected daily to a miserable commute 60 miles daily in all kinds of weather and it has performed beautifully! We have nearly 209000 miles on it and have only had one issue with it the power steering was giving us some issues at about the ten year mark... Honda worked through it even called in the engineers that designed the car and figured out that it was a pinhole leak in the vacuum hose... Honda covered EVERYTHING and we didn't pay a dime... Wonderful support from the dealer and manufacturer!  The car has been driven across country a half dozen times and is so comfortable to drive on the long haul...  I hope to keep it for another ten years!  Just get the oil changed religiously and do the maintenance and Hondas will last forever! My first Honda was a 1988 Civic with a manual transmission and I drove that for 250000 miles...,
2004,06-11-2006,3,0,2, Researched and test drove the 2003 but waited for the 2004 in hope of Honda removing any bugs. At 19000 miles the radiator had to be replaced due to a split seam. At 20186 the ECT sensor was replaced. At 20300 the thermostat was replaced. At  22495 the fuel pump/filter assembly was replaced. At 23500 the PCM was replaced. The the fuel injectors were replaced during same service visit. The vehicle is in the dealership (not the one purchased from) having the head gaskets replaced. This is the seventh trip to the same dealership to repair the check engine light and VTM- 4 light on. We have the technology to put a man on the moon and safely return him but I can't get my car fixed.,
2004,18-01-2012,3,0.5983,5,It has nice power and runs very well.,
2004,17-02-2012,3,0.92,4.5,  I bought this car with over a 100K on it and have had it for about a year.,
2004,05-04-2016,3,0.9678,5,We like the roominess for passengers and the cargo space available when 3rd row is down. 3rd row seating is nice and it even has cupholders and good visibility out of rear side windows.  Legroom in 3rd row is okay for small adults but 2nd row is quite comfortable for an 3 average or larger adults or 3 car seats. Car handles highway drives very well. Seats are comfortable for long trips and ride is smooth. Car has held up quite well over our 4 year ownership term. We also use it for camping trips and have had no issue with trekking over rocky muddy or dirty roads. Highly recommend!,
2004,03-03-2008,4,0,4.5,Better brake rotors and better fuel economy.,
2004,31-10-2010,4,-0.6256,4.25, Bought new still running great at over 90K.  Comfortable and non-fatiguing--I've driven dozens of 1000+ mile trips in it most in 1 shot.  I love the storage space between the front seats--still haven't seen another SUV like it. Brakes started pulsing at 45K machining helps only temporarily. Cannot get EPA gas mileage.  I like at new SUVs and just don't see anything I'd like better so I'll just keep this one as long as it's reliable. ,
2004,28-10-2011,4,0.7003,4.625, What's not to like? Never thought I'd own an SUV. Pilot gives better mileage than my Subaru. Reliability can't compare. Changed tires at 60k brakes at 90k brake light bulb headlamps now at 104k miles.,

2005,13-10-2010,1,0,1.5, After out 2010 Chrysler Town & Country was totaled we found this beauty on the lot. It's pretty to look at the paint on this thing is AMAZING. We like that the outside looks small but there's 8 seats. It's really fun and smooth to drive too. Just wish that you could get DVD entertainment along with Navigation at the same time not sure why that wasn't possible.,

2005,31-03-2005,3,0,2.25, My wife and I purchased our frist new car a 2004 Honda Pilot.  At 19k miles we had to have the block replaced due to a cracked block being installed at the factory.  Now Honda America is giving us the run around on the warranty...beware!,
2005,15-04-2008,3,-0.8858,5, Purchased this Honda because it carries up to 8 people we didn't want a bigger SUV.  The battery died in the first year while on a trip had to replace it.  The rear latch for the hatch has fallen off three times and I have had to screw it back on.  Makes a loud noise when driving at highway speed with windows down.  Now at 63000 miles we have a broken motor mount.  None of these items are serious but I expected more from Honda especially for the money we paid (we purchased the top model of the Pilot).  The gas mileage also isn't very good for a 6 cylinder.,
2005,20-08-2010,3,-0.5707,4.875, Two areas of concern: poor sound system (need to fiddle fiddle fiddle with dials when switching from talk to music) and tailgate height when open. Other than those it is a strong value. Very capable in icy snowy conditions.  ,
2005,13-10-2010,3,0.4404,1.5, The car is great. Except the All wheel drive maintenance!  I change the engine oil every 3K but the differential HAS to be changed every 5K  (6K).  This is pricey at every other oil change. Other than that I would probably buy another one in 12 years.  I also found and replaced the air filter with a cold air intake.  A little bit better gas mileage and bit better performance off the line.,
2005,14-10-2010,3,0.6249,5, I've had my pilot for about 8 months now. Between work college and family I put many miles on my pilot and find it is still very reliable. Although it cost me more than I wanted to spend this car is truly a great investment. I bought it knowing that I will have a family someday and this vehicle will stand the test of time. Got into an accident a month after I bought it. Totaled half of the other vehicle. My pilot had nothing but a scratch on the bumper and I didn't even know I hit the other car. Safety is one of the best features of the Pilot. I never felt the impact of the accident! I spent a year researching before making my purchase. Glad I picked the Pilot! ,
2005,20-02-2016,3,0.9587,5, Blown engine at 74k miles. No consideration or ,

2006,01-04-2011,1,0.9598,5,Powerful yet efficient incredible versatility and storage awesome traction control interior comfort features smooth car-like ride. Under seat storage in the back seat or innovative flip-up seats are awesome for storage. Love the trunk - store my tools and lock them up or store luggage for road trips. Even has a drain plug to use as a cooler for tailgating! Love how the gate folds down or swings out making it easy to access loads by getting right up against the bed. Honda innovation!,

2006,31-03-2015,1,0.9869,4.75,"Stereo - they didn't add an auxiliary jack for iPods until later models. Stereo has an ""aux"" button label but you can only use in lieu of XM by installing another device to connect to it. The trunk ""touch latch"" does not open anymore I have to open with the key even when unlocked. ",
2006,15-05-2009,2,0.9396,4.125,The rigid body coupled with the independent suspension all around gives the truck a great feel on the highway and great traction. In towing the disadvantage of not having a solid rear axle to dominate the load is made up for with the excellent traction of the rear end.,
2006,21-10-2009,2,0,4.5, I bought my Pilot just 5 months ago with 42000 miles on it. It lacked some of the exterior style elements of the competition but the interior features seem to fit our lifestyle better. The determining factor was the safety rating. This vehicle won out hands down! Lucky for me because last week I totaled my poor Pilot. This vehicle did exactly what it was supposed to do. Protect the occupants. My car's front end was totally smashed the hood was folded nearly as high as the roof and I was protected in the cab. Other than bruises from the restraints and air bag deployment I am fine and totally amazed. So now the painful part finding another one.    ,
2006,11-06-2010,2,0.4184,4.625, I'm one of those who has a lot of use for a truck but who doesn't much like the traditional pickup arrangement. Honda did an intelligent job of rethinking the pickup and came up with something that for this user continues to make a whole lot of sense. I've hauled a great deal with it from wobbly old wooden boats to loads of lumber carrying 6500 pounds at 70 mph over hundreds of miles sometimes. This truck can do the work. Meanwhile I can keep my tools secure in the trunk not out in an open bed. I can carry long lumber and spars on the roof rack. It's awesome on snowy variable roads or blasting down a dirt road at 40 mph. 87k on the first set of tires. Don't get the RT--the seats stain,
2006,25-07-2010,2,0.6239,4.75,"This an early model - only the driver's door unlocks when put in 'Park' - late '06 onwards have all four doors unlock. That's a nuisance! Another 1"" of ground clearance. Improved mileage. Auto lights; got used to this feature on GM machines. Now I forget to turn on the lights and get flashed a lot!",
2006,26-08-2010,2,0.3612,4.75, I recently bought a 2006 RT from a local Honda Dealer with 120000 km on it - tonneau cover too. I had been looking at them for sometime; I needed a strong reliable but comfortable truck or SUV to handle our cottage lifestyle. Towing boats trailers full of work materials or ATVs etc. but comfortable and easy to drive. Research indicated that used Ridgeline would meet all these requirements. In Billet Silver it looks pretty sharp although some in my family think it's the ugliest truck they've ever seen! But I love it! Two months into ownership and 2500 extra km on the clock it's smooth powerful reliable good on gas (averaging 10.5 L/100 km or 22/23 mpg and very comfortable.,
2006,21-10-2011,2,0.8213,4.875, I've had a '86 Toyota 4x4 P/U '93 Toyota 4Runner and '05 Tundra. I bought the Tundra brand new over the Ridgeline because the Ridgeline had just come out in summer of '05 and I was hesitant to jump into Honda's first truck. What a mistake! I sold the Tundra and bought an '06 Ridgeline RTL. It is so versatile and fun to drive. Great on all kinds of terrain. Excellent utility with the bed trunk back seat (seats flip up for TONS of space). We go up to Colorado in the winter to ski I fit all of our gear in the trunk and under the rear seats skis in the bed and the 4 of us ride in comfort! I get 19mpg city and have done as good as 24mpg highway. Awesome truck!,
2006,24-02-2016,2,0.872,5, Oir Honda Pilot is the best. It is so versatile and big yet drives like a small car. We have never brought the car into a repair shop for anything more than scheduled maintenance. I swear this car will run for ever. The interior has supportive seats and after 100k there is not a tear in the drivers seat leather not even wore out. Really good on the snow stability control barges in exactly when u need it. It is really just like a box so visibility is crazy good. Rearward visibility is as good as it gets with a back up camera. The only feature I would like on this pilot is just a little more horse power and torque it never feels stressed but I just LOVE power.,
2006,23-09-2005,3,0.9384,4.75, This vehicle rides as smoothly and quietly as any car and is a pleasure to drive. It is easily manuverable corners well and is not sluggish in passing situations. Gas mileage is acceptable for this type of vehicle and the interior features are easily utilized and convenient. It is asthetically pleasing and turns heads which is uncommon for a SUV. It lives up to Honda's high quality standards and is user friendly both for family and individuals. It is roomy inside and able to haul a lot of cargo kids supplies etc. Seating configuration is good and easily modified and accessed. I really cannot think of anything I dislike about the Pilot. ,
2006,24-09-2006,3,0.8172,4.875, I purchase my suv brand new...After putting 76k miles the car still drives really good.,

2006,11-12-2011,3,0.8322,4.375,Biggest beef towing! You have to have components added to the engine in order to tow anything!  I don't recall that finding in my first research. So if you're hoping to tow the 3500 lbs the vehicle's rated for plan on spending about $1200 to get the equipment added. ,

2006,10-01-2014,3,0,5," I've had 3 Rams ('96 '00 '02) '95 Chevy Silverado '89 Ford Ranger all purchased new or nearly new at the time. All were ""ok"" but this is the most utilitarian versatile dependable luxurious truck of all! I waited a while to see if any of the domestic idiots would develop a comparable truck. Chevy is the closest with the Avalanche but too big and too thirsty. Say what you want about the Ridgelines tow limitations or lack of low range this truck will fill the bill for a large number of truck owners. Get over yourselves you all don't need a full size gas guzzling domestic. ",
2006,30-07-2015,3,0.4927,5," I bought new 9/06. This SUV has everything- comfort and capacity you can haul a lot! This pilot grew with my family! I've hauled 7 kids...5 kids and their stuff...multiple hockey bags and the hockey kids! We grew up through sports summer and winter. The reliability of this car has been amazing! Because it will be 10 next year I have started looking at maybe a new car. I cannot find anything out there that may hold a candle to this SUV. I didn't even mention that this baby got me through a few of the worst winters in Michigan history!!! In a foot+ of snow...I only put it in 4WD to back out my drive...then off and away through about 18"" in 2!!! If you only had the 2 wheel version- you would be fine in very deep snow. It handles unbelievably well. Once on a very narrow snow covered road after bad storm there wasn't enough room for an oncoming car to pass...I pulled into the ""bank"" on the side of the road with the hope ""we can do this""...and other car passed and I ""plowed"" through!! On my way again in 2WD! As everyone has said- the only maintenance...normal brakes tires...and very recently an alternator. The warning light went off- my husband checked- it was the alternator.

2006,10-11-2006,4,0,4.875, The trunk on the ridgeline is the best idea for a pickup.  Larger bed would have helped.  Made to drive on long trips in comfort.  Backseat fold up gives more room for backseat storage.  Good service at Atlantic Honda keeps me informed of needed maintenance.,

The Pilot now has 216000 miles on it and runs as good as the day we bought it. Maintenance over the years has been brakes  rotors  a timing belt at 140000 miles. Other than standard upkeep  the radiator was replaced ( pin hole leak )  and an alternator around 200000 miles.

I got 25 mpg on the highway.  I paid $3000. less than I was quoted on the Toyota Highlander and this is a good bit larger vehicle.  This has got to be the best SUV in this size class.  Before purchasing I check the sales prices of 3 yr. old Pilots with over 50000 miles and they were selling for only $5000. less than I paid for thes 2007 model.  How's that for not much depreciation!,
2007,13-12-2006,1,0.9821,4.5,Include more options from the factory to cut down their cost.  I honestly don't see any problems.

2007,19-12-2006,1,0,4.25, The most fun car I have ever driven....however the fuel mileage is extremely bad. It should be 33 and 38. I am getting 18 and 23.

However I have not been disappointed other than the low front bumper that I had to get repaired twice. (at no cost). I just recently took my littel red car to PA from VA. She did great!!! I filled up my tank once going and once leaving without stopping for gas I made it to my destinations leaving 1/4 tank of gas.

It's very smooth and you'd be more than happy with its power as long as you are not a racing car driver. Still in break-in its highway mileage already hit what is listed. I got 46 this afternoon! (of course air-con was off and I used N for a couple of times:-) I love the ease to pull it out from parking lots because it doesn't have a sedan trunk! The ride is quiet but is not as comfortable as a mid-size sedan. You shall avoid Fit if you require a soft comfortable ride.,

2007,19-09-2006,4,0.8019,4.875, I've had LOTS of cars because I quickly get bored of them. I came across a deal on my 2007 Pilot EXL used in July 2015. It was a one owner and had been hit in the rear but repaired so I got it for $4000. I have taken long road trips and it's my daily commuter about 50 miles a day stop and go city and highway driving. This SUV does everything I need it to do. It's got speed on the highway even at 70 I can punch it to pass and it reacts quickly. Mine has leather and the seats are very comfortable and I am a big guy (6' and 250) I have plenty of head/leg room. Nice big armrest. Lots of storage. I have AWD and this thing will NOT get stuck but I have all terrain tires. I've only had it 9 months but I love it just as much as the day I bought it. Has 240000 miles and drives like new because the previous owner kept timing belt and all maintenance up to date. I plan on getting a good 300k easy. I wrote my novella here hope it helps! :),

What we found that at several thousands less and with all of the features we wanted including Rear backup camera and DVD navigation we couldn't shy away from the value this vehicle has to offer. With the money we saved we opted for several accessories to add some class such as wood trim and chrome tubes steps and we still only hit the $31000 mark. We got a great deal and a awesome car. This vehicle's MSRp with Accessories is over $36000 wow.  You won't be disappointed. One note though if there is any thing I would change it would be a tighter or firmer steering ,

2007,12-12-2006,4,0,4.75, The family is soon to grow again so we decided to swap out the '03 CRV.  While the mileage suffered (not surprisingly) we're so happy with our decision to go with the Pilot.  It's a blast to drive and has so many handy little features that we didn't realize we were missing out on.  Incredibly solid on the road -- feels very substantial without feeling just plain BIG.  We're just hoping this thing performs as well in snow as the CRV did (I've read less than stellar reviews on the Goodyear Integrity tires that come on the Pilot).  So far we love it.     ,

2007,21-12-2006,4,0.7764,4.875, After debating between the 2007 Ridgeline and the 2007 Ford Sport Trac I went with the Ridgeline and am glad that I did.  The Ridgeline is a wonderful tough truck and drives like a dream.  I am not a truck person per se but need an open truck bed for Home Depot runs and hauling two large dogs around town and this truck fills that need and more.  The in-bed trunk is the best as it is located at the tail gate the Sport Trac's large in- bed trunk is located behind the rear window so you would have to get up into the bed just to put something in the trunk.  For the first 1500 miles I have been averaging 18 mpg in the City.  Not bad for truck this size.  The V6 engine offers plenty of power.,
2007,24-12-2006,4,0.7184,4.625,mileage was as stated about 15 city and 20 hwy. I would like to see a little larger engine and a bit longer bed. overall a very good vehicle in snow or rain. I wish the 4 wheel system allowed you to lock in above 25 mph. Even though it  didn't I never got stuck so maybe it doesn't matter,
2007,25-12-2006,4,0,4.875, Unless you intend to off-road the Ridgeline is pretty much perfect.  The ride is smooth quiet and refined.  The engine won't kill you with acceleration but it's better than adequate.  Inside materials and design are amazing. Safety features abound.  Perfect for long road trips daily commuting and everything in between.  Gas mileage is better than expected-- 18 in mixed city/freeway up to 22 or 23 on road trips.  Only complaint is that the exterior is very susceptible to dings-- the paint/body hardware could probably use some reinforcement.   People who review this automobile poorly probably have never been in one.  ,
2007,27-12-2006,4,0.6369,5," My first car was a 90 Civic hatchback so it's been interesting comparing the similarities and differences. Much easier to enter/exit more useable space much more power (even with auto). Having a small child the rear seat height and tall roof make it relatively easy to put him in and out of the car seat. Took looong roadtrip with my wife and child and enjoyed the comfort of ""relax mode"" even with the trunk full of stuff. Great highway mileage (37-40) but city mileage has been lackluster for such a small car (23-26). So far that has been my biggest gripe. ",
2007,28-12-2006,4,0.9005,4.875, My first brand new car - have normally driven v6s or  v8s.  Took time to get used to v4 engine but once you figure it out that's when the fun begins.  It turns on a dime and the versatility of cargo space is incredible.  I moved a friend with just my fit--she couldn't believe this little car that could!!  Agree that the two back headrests cause blind spot and would have liked a moon or sun roof option but all in all it's your best bang for the buck!!  Not to mention the side curtain airbags and sound system which is pretty good for standard.  Love my car and love the mileage!!,
2007,31-12-2006,4,0,4.375, Went with the 2007 Pilot over the CRV to get extra space as we often total 4 adult passengers and sometimes more.  CRV felt a little tight for 4 tops.  Preferred the superior quality of the leather in the Pilot.  CRV leather felt thin and has a tufted look which some may prefer but we don't.  CRV felt somewhat underpowered but not too bad.  No question the Pilot has plenty of power.  Overall very pleased with the Pilot. Expecting it will do well in the snow if we get any.  ,

2008,03-04-2008,1,0.6369,5, I have always been a truck owner and have never been a fan of foreign made trucks.  With gas prices on the rise and every year fewer and fewer trips to Home Depot for home and yard repair I started looking at something more economic.  I did all of my homework because I needed a crew cab for my family.  I went with the Honda because it offered more for my money.  It was about 5000 cheaper than the Toyota it has a high resale value better gas economy cheaper insurance and was more comfortable.   I also would note that I do not haul trailers boats etc...  for the average Joe this is a vehicle that is family friendly rides like a car and looks like a truck!!!,

2008,09-02-2010,1,0,3.375, Even though I'm not crazy about the looks I do enjoy driving the car...for me it's comfortable accelerates well and gets very good mileage. Recently the battery wouldn't start and after reading other forums regarding this issue I see that there are many many people with even more mileage and less that have had either the same problem (battery not charging) or battery dieing within less than 2 years! That is why I gave it a low reliability rating. The battery is not replaceable either (no one seems to make a similar size so one is stuck with the poor quality battery).,

2008,14-05-2016,1,0.7058,5, I would say up until a couple of months ago I would rated my Honda Fit a easy 5 out 5 stars UNTIL I crossed the 150000 mark. I will let it be known I've been the sole owner of this car and have all maintenance done at Honda (oil changes/inspections). Since passing the 150k mark I've had the car towed twice once for a bad fuel pump ($700) the second time because the accelerator coils and water pump went out completely. The second issue ended up costing around $1500 because valve adjustments and new parts. The check engine light has come on several times since and needless to say I'm now afraid of driving this thing down the street. So beware after 150k it's a money pit!,
2008,07-09-2007,2,0.3182,4.875, I recently purchased a honda fit for my daughter and she absolutly loves it. I was quite sceptical about it at first but after driving it and using it for storage purposes it is truly an amazing little car.,

2008,30-01-2013,2,0.2942,4.25, I bought my Fit new in 2008. At the time I loved it. Since then its various issues have worn down my support for the vehicle. Now I'm considering selling it even though it's still pretty new. The ride quality and road noise are getting to me and the car lacks certain basic amenities like cruise control (my fault for getting the base model) adjustable intermittent length for the front wipers (that's right it's every 4 seconds or nothing) and any intermittent setting for the rear wiper (it's either on or off).,

2008,03-01-2010,3,0,4.75, I'm sad to see my Ridgeline lease come to an end.  Never been in a truck that rode as smooth or quiet.  It handled beautifully too.  Interior was spacious in the front and the back plenty of room for 4 adults and 5 if necessary. The rear seat swinging up came in handy.  The inbed trunk is huge and was great for storing various items including a golf bag.  The only negative I can give this is that I live in Philadelphia and it got a little less than 15 mpg.  It's the only reason I'm giving it up.  When they come out with a hybrid I'll be back :) ,
2008,16-09-2010,3,0.4404,4.375,Only thing that could use a little bit of help is the color selection. Need more colors!!,
2008,19-05-2011,3,0.9082,2.625,The MP3 input is great and the car just runs and runs with no hiccups,
2008,21-01-2016,3,0.9433,4,All of the comfort features nice design for a big man fits family of four easily and the hidden storage/cooler/trunk.,
2008,16-03-2008,4,-0.508,5, When my 1999 Civic was stolen and would have cost too much money to repair I was heartbroken. I didn't have much money at the time and couldn't afford to buy a new Civic (and the new ones didn't appeal to me) so I started looking at more affordable cars but really didn't want anything but a Honda. The Fit was a perfect match for me. What made me attracted to it was the hatchback and extra trunk space because I barely ever have passengers. When I had the Civic it was always a pain to fit things in the trunk and fold the seats down with only 2 doors. It felt cramped especially with passengers in the back seat. ,
2008,11-12-2009,4,0.743,3.75,Lots of cargo space easy to fold seats simple but quirky exterior shape tight turning radius fits in small parking spaces great visibility out of all windows defrosts and heats up quickly tire pressure gauge has a lot of pep nice interior colors extra protection with the ignition lock.  The best part... nobody wants to steal a Honda Fit!,
2008,10-10-2010,4,0.9387,4.75, Awesome room inside and very creative use of space. Friend had leg surgery: We were able to put down the front seat (flat) & she sat in back with her leg completely extended. Transported a 9x12 rug with no problem. Got 42 mpg on a road trip out west. Minor complaints: the Sport trim hangs too low and gets scratched up easily. My fog lights have both broken twice (not protected enough?). No map lights. Road noise. Overall though a nearly perfect car in terms of economy excellent use of space being fun to drive and (dare I say it?) basic cuteness. This is an AWESOME car for the price!!,
2009,07-03-2009,1,0.7845,4.875,RT model should come with 7-pin rv hook-up as standard like RTl and RTs.  I had dealer add this item in with the sale.,
2009,10-11-2009,1,0.9382,4.875,Runs great Honda reliability. Drive and rides nice. A multi-use vehicle for the everyday man. ,
2009,23-01-2010,1,0.7096,4.75,Trunk that doubles as a cooler. dual open tail gate. Windows open by using the key in the door lock. Back seats flip and lock in the upright position for more storage.,
2009,20-02-2010,1,0.3612,4.625, We were looking for a versatile vehicle the Ridgeline RTS fits the bill perfectly. We didn't need a work horse like a Ford 150 or GMC mule. I don't need to run off road over rocks and through rivers. The Ridgeline is very comfortable quiet and the styling does turn heads. Getting 17 in the city and have seen 22.8 on the highway. Use cruise control for best mileage. I enjoy having a good handling vehicle for hauling those lighter loads and towing my 20' boat If you are a not in need of a big truck and want reasonable utility this is your vehicle. Take it from me you won't be sorry. ,
2009,18-06-2010,1,0.7351,4.375, Not real quick but will tow well and is build like a brick **** house.  A 17 year old plowed in the back end of my truck and you could barely tell. Her car had to be towed.  ,

2009,12-08-2010,2,0.6369,3.75, The mileage is Terrible for a V6 and it is really not very powerful of an engine. The paint is chipping off of mine fairly easily.  Luckily I bought the paint plan.  I am towing a camper and am already looking to a V8.  I like the trunk and bed gate.  Stereo is TERRIBLE.  Does not even have IPOD jack.  Overall it is ok but not thrilled.  Every time I go for an oil change they find something to get the cost up to over $100.00  Our dealer outsources the paint dept. which I did not realize until after the purchase.,
2009,26-07-2009,3,0.9818,3.625,Add standard central console for storage and cupholders improve headlights for nighttime visibility add a more comfortable seat with optional electric controls strengthen inner armrest increase size/length of window shades.,
2009,31-07-2009,3,0.8777,4.25," Compared to and test drove Mini Cooper Mini Clubman Scion D etc. to replace a 1986 Toyota 4 wheel drive x'tra cab pick-up used for personal and small real estate business. With back seats down it works well to transport my mutts and for business. Did not like ""paddle shifting""; standard is very responsive. Had dealer install moon-roof similar to those on accords and it is fabulous. Get all the rubber floor trays. Navigation system very useful and stability control makes my wife feel safe. Also got Plexiglas strips on doors for shade and rain protection as well as fancy door strips and a black rear bumper protector strip--all the bells and whistles.",

2009,29-07-2010,3,0.5255,4.375,quieter inside. Honda would it kill you to drop in $150 of sound insulation? Keep the fluids fresh as it affects gas mileage greatly (3-4 mpg). If this were quieter it's a 5 out of 5 but don't expect it to replace a full size truck that's not a beef just a reality. The Ridgeline was meant to fill a different niche which it does nicely I just wish it did it with less interior noise.,
2009,10-08-2010,3,0.4404,4.875, I've owned this truck for approx. 4 years 60k miles. Like the size engine is decent (engine started to feel better at around 50k miles) tows fine (i'm towing just under the 5k lb. limit but not long distances). Here's my main beef..the wind noise is ungodly! Would buy again in an instant if,
2009,18-09-2010,3,0,4.5,Telescoping steering wheel.  V8 engine.  Better stereo The wire harness for the hitch should come standard.  DUH..  You cant really tow without lights.  Floor mats do not come with it and are $400.00.  I know WHAT?,
2009,17-04-2013,3,-0.5076,3.25,Trunk in the bed and tail gate swing open or folds down.  Also the trunk is supposed to also serve as a cooler with a plug in the bottom.,
2009,18-11-2009,4,0.4033,4.875, I am a high-spirited driver and drive 110 miles one-way to work so needed a fuel efficient car that had zip. 10000+ miles already since June 2008. Depending on my driving habits I average 40+ highway/35 mixed (highest was 52 MPG for one trip at 60 MPH!). This car has great acceleration when you punch it for entering traffic and passing but don't expect a rocket car. Maneuverability is excellent although real tight cornering causes the back end to sway. The seats are not very comfortable for long distances but I generally like the interior styling. Visibility is excellent with nice large side mirrors. Nice rear seat flexibility for transporting my big dog and cargo. Great car overall!,
2009,23-11-2009,4,0.4927,4.75, I bought a Ridgeline 3 weeks ago.  Have used it for hauling dirt bikes firewood and took it deer hunting in the woods.  This thing does it all for the everyday man.  Not for the contractor worker.  Runs great peppy hugs the road - no lean. First out I did trip displays got 18.2 - 20.3 mpg.  Not bad for 500 miles on it.  Compares to mpg on my Chevy silverado.  Roomy front and back seats and lots of storage.  Love the trunk idea.  Works great for locking the chain saw in and other valuables.  A good all-around multi-use vehicle for the everyday dad/man.  ,
2009,23-12-2009,4,0.8941,4, Bought this truck to carry two Honda dirt bikes in the back and to tow a tent trailer all at the same time. I love this truck and it does everything I need a truck to do and more. Plus it is a Honda with outstanding quality fantastic ride and great gas mileage for a bigger truck. I test drove all the new trucks before buying and the Honda Ridgeline was by far the best truck for my lifestyle. I live in snow country and the AWD system works great. Honda's design for utility and storage is excellent. ,
2009,07-01-2010,4,0,4.5,Needs way better fuel economy. Telescoping steering wheel. I pod connection standard. make the wiring harness and floor mats standard.  DUH. OH and needs a way better sound system.  Other than that I LOVE THIS TRUCK.,
2010,20-03-2010,1,0.8591,3.625,Make front of car higher so will not scrape on concrete parking blocks. Change upholstery so does not attract lint and dog hair so much. Make sure Honda provides mpg they advertise.,
2010,13-05-2010,1,0.7469,3.875,I like the way the car holds the road and drives. It's good looking on the exterior. Great air conditioner,
2010,31-05-2010,1,0.9489,4.5," Just traded up from an '06 RTL with Navi and many features have been improved.  Some complain that we have not yet seen a complete redesign of the RL yet I couldn't be happier.  New Bali Blue color is the best yet.  Improved gauges and touch points versus the '06.  Integrated fog lights slight horsepower gain (feels like substantially more) better software ""tweaked"" transmission bluetooth and information center.  Interior design improved (toned down those metallic door handles) and carpeted floor mats versus the rubber of old.  I'm in the business of mechanical devices (I drive a RL to move them) and can attest that several years into a platform enhances reliability.",
2010,26-06-2010,2,0,4.25,I finally broke-down and bought a used one this fall and I love it.,
2010,30-07-2010,2,0.6369,4.5, I don't know what I am doing wrong but I cannot get more than 24-25 mpg no matter how I drive. This is frustrating. Otherwise love the way it drives especially holds the road.  I appreciate the lumbar support on driver's seat. ,
2010,03-10-2011,2,0.7351,4.5, I resisted buying a ridgeline for years because of its looks because it's not a real truck and the price.,
2010,12-03-2010,3,-0.1803,3.25, I bought this car just 1 week ago and am instantly regretting it.  It is the loudest car I have ever owned.  It gives me headaches with the constant drone of the engine and road noise.  I have owned a VW diesel in the past so this is saying something.  It is fun to drive and practical but the seats are uncomfortable the materials inside are cheap.  DO yourself a favor and pass on this car.  I will be selling mine this week.  ,

2010,11-08-2010,4,0.1154,4.875, I've had my Fit for 6 months and have really enjoyed driving it and have had no problems with it. I do a combination of city/highway driving and average 36- 37 mpg overall. I have the Sport package which overall has a great look and is fun to drive. I did purchase floor mats body side moldings and window tint after market (see below re:improvements). As others have stated the upholstery attracts fuzz so I carry a lint roller in the car. ,
2010,16-09-2010,4,0.7717,5,Change fabric to something that is not a dirt/fuzz magnetadd armrest on front passenger side add standard body side moldings (to prevent door dings) add standard window tint and floor mats,
2010,08-11-2010,4,0.0258,2.875," I bought the Fit Sport automatic for a commuter car. It is fun to drive though I've been a bit disappointed with the gas mileage. I'm averaging 29 but at least half of it is highway driving.  Pros: Fun to drive Decent ""pep"" Good handling Fit/finish excellent Small size allows you to park just about anywhere  Cons: Underpowered AC - car is a mini solar oven with all the glass and black interior. AC has to stay cranked to cool the car.  Poor cup holder placement - ones between gear shift and dash useless. Ones in front of vents need closed in order to keep coffee warm while AC is on.  No drivers lumbar adjustment  Flimsy trunk panel covering spare - can't hold much weight.  ",

2011,12-09-2010,1,0.9537,4.125, I'm 56 years young and just turned in my leased 550SL. I decided to look for a sporty hybrid that would hold golf clubs plants trays blue tooth and groceries. My rule is only buy groceries that will fit into my car.  It seats felt identical to the 550SL (without the leather and heated seats). It was easy to drive and fuel efficient. IPOD connection as well as lap top. Has everything I need and fuel efficient. I just returned from Denmark and realized that Americans have it backwards and this is my step to help the economy as well as my pocket book. I recommend you take for a test yourselves.,
2011,01-12-2010,1,0.2263,4.625, As a previous owner of a CRX-DX (7-years) this CRZ is a welcome pleasure. I traded in my 2001 A4 1.8TQ for this little piece of heaven. It is nice getting back to a smooth clutch. The Audi was a little long on both travel and throw. The exterior styling is a mix of Porsche 928 rear end & heavily modified S2000 front. The interior high end with soft touch controls like the Audi. The well placed control close to the driver. The 6 weeks has been unbelievable in the gas mileage. I am just about to fill up for the third time with: 41.7 43.5 and 43.4 for miles/gal. avg. Not bad for a 80 City / 20 Highway driving. There seems to be no difference in Normal / Econ mode on mileage just on stop idle.,
2011,09-06-2011,1,0.7871,5,Quick quiet and a great highway cruiser . 35 mpg plus on highway trips at 75-80. Car has great visibility a huge trunk  and a spacious back seat. The 4 cylinder has plenty of power . The original equipment Dunlap tired were horrible I put Bridgestones on at 30000 miles and she's quiet and smooth. ,
2011,05-10-2011,1,0.9116,3.625,It's really fun to drive and great on gas. We easily average about 40mpg,
2011,21-11-2011,1,-0.9495,2.75, I bought a new Civic about a year ago. It has been to the shop 4 times already. Once for a stuck window once for a door that wouldn't close and once for a grinding engine noise. The car was brought in today due to peeling door covers. The dealer has been very difficult in fixing these issues. The quality of the paint and over all materials are poor.,
2011,05-04-2012,1,0.34,5,Heated seats would be nice - std. or option. Auto dimming of both inside & outside would help. ,
2011,03-11-2010,2,0.81,4.125,Ok. Onto the bad. I have two minor complaints about the car.  1) I agree about the headlights. They're not AS BAD as one reviewer makes them sound but they are sub-par. I can CLEARLY see where I am going but sometimes we wonder if our headlights are on. That's not ok. But I am just going to switch them out eventually. Easy fix.  2) My biggest gripe about this car. ITS SO LOW! I love low cars. I have a classic Camaro that sits just about as low as any other car. But it's the nose that's the problem here. I can't even park my car in the garage or drive way because it scrapes so bad. It scrapes going out of parking garages parking lots etc.   Even with those issues still love the car.,
2011,29-03-2011,2,0.8761,5,The stop/idle function great coasting to a light under 19 mph with the engine off. No problems with blind stops you need to set the outside mirror correctly. Smooth 6-sp. manual interior design & layout. The battery boost is quick to the call when needed. The sport mode is nice on the on ramps. ,

2011,17-03-2015,2,-0.7841,2.625,If a leaf falls on it the car will scratch. The placement of the speedometer makes it very difficult to see and the light coloring stains easily. I am looking at trading mine in and getting another make of car. They just aren't what they used to be. ,
2011,02-12-2015,2,0.5709,5, this car is powerful for Honda. Amazing power voommmmm. MPG is average for what its worth..,

2011,07-09-2010,3,0.2023,4.75, I traded in my 2007 Ford edge for the 2011 cr-z ex CVT. At first I had to get used to much less room and lower visibility but fun driving and spending 50% less gas money is great and helps to comfort me in other ways. ,
2011,13-09-2010,3,0.4926,4.75,Hybrid of course. The little fin antennae on top. Lots of nooks and crannies to store things in. USB for the stereo.,
2011,20-10-2010,3,-0.296,4.875,And I look good in it!,
2011,29-10-2010,3,0.6696,4.75,I've had it a week and have averaged 45mpg just jetting around. I love that it's a hybrid but not boring. We are empty nesters so the 2 seater is great for us. The hatch area comfortably fits our 35 lb dog. We are tall but fit very comfortably with plenty of leg and headroom. Great stereo even in the base model and the silver mesh seats are really nice. ,
2011,23-04-2011,3,0,5,Change the location of the speedometer. Better car quality. Darker interior. Dealers who actually help with issues. ,
2011,20-11-2010,4,0.7788,4.125,"I have had people stop and ask ""what is that?"" and have seen people checking it out in parking lots. Getting mileage over 41 mpg.",
2011,15-01-2011,4,0.8777,4.75,By far the room.  Fun to Drive.  Easy on the eyes compared to most hybrids... it's got that sporty look.  Interior design is spent only on the front seats. Well there are only two seats of course but it's nice to have a car that's made for the driver (and a friend).,
2011,12-02-2011,4,0.6705,5, I love this car!,
2011,21-07-2011,4,0,5, I have my CRZ about 3 months now and LOVE IT!! I saw one on the road and followed it to find out what it was and that is was a hybrid sold me on it!,
2011,11-01-2013,4,0.9595,4.75, First off I love my CRZ. We were on a waiting list to get one when they first came out. Test drove it and it was instant love. Having had the car for about two years now we still love it. Part of me wishes they would come out with a 4 seater version but then I guess it would loose some of its appeal? There is a WHOLE lot of room in this tiny car. I kid you not we bought a queen sized bed frame mattress etc (From Ikea of course -.-) and we fit it in the car?! Amazing. It also fits multiple full sized bikes without taking off the wheels. I don't recommend it.. you might mark your interior plastics.. ,
2011,26-03-2015,4,0.7506,4.125,Love this car.,
2011,20-12-2015,4,-0.2235,1, This is my second Honda and I regretted buying both. Our troubles started immediately with the A/C. The dealer replaced the compressor TWICE (Honda replacement parts are rebuilt!!) and then replaced almost every other part of the A/C system including the 3rd compressor. I took it to another repair shop and they found a broken expansion valve but the system failed again a short time later. I also had issues with the rear window lifts. After the dealer tried to fix the problem numerous times I finally called Honda HQ and they replaced both rear window registers. The paint on the top was beginning to wear off!! Gas mileage dropped from 32 MPG to less than 28 for no reason. I finally traded it in with just 11000 miles for a new 2015 KIA Soul which we love.,
2012,27-08-2012,1,0.9674,4.75,I've owned my CR-z for about 6 months now. This car is really comfortable-- I love that the seats hug you. I also like all the bells and whistles like blue tooth phone connection radio adjustment from the steering wheel and a USB port to hook up my ipod. ,
2012,02-12-2012,1,0.9519,4.5,"I must start out by commenting on the speed and power of this car. I definitely feel the ""pro"" reviewers are overly critical of this point. I've driven faster cars and while this isn't going to win many races it has more than ample power and torque to make it quick and nimble and very enjoyable to drive. So far on my commute around Seattle which includes heavy traffic and some fairly open highways I get roughly 43 mpg using econ mode. I haven't tested with normal or sport. Overall I love my car it's a joy to look at and drive and it sure feels good to help the earth save money and not having to fill up every few days.",
2012,29-02-2012,2,0.9619,5,Not much other than bells and whistles. Would have loved a sunroof option.,
2012,21-05-2012,2,0.5719,5, Had this car for 5 months now and can't wait to drive it each day. We live in the Rockies and travel to Salt Lake Utah valley often. Love the ride up and down the mountains. No lost of power coming up. Fuel average is 40 mpg. Sport car all the way!,
2012,04-04-2012,3,0.5994,5, I love this car! I bought it because I wanted a fuel efficient car that was also fun to drive. This car is definitely fun to drive and I love getting into it each morning. ,
2012,24-04-2012,4,0.2481,5, I saw a couple of these running around town but never really stopped to look. I began calculating gas costs of my 1997 gas eater and decided it was time to look around. I looked at all kinds of different models hybrids new used etc. I finally settled on the CR-Z as my first choice for test drive and once I drove it that was it. If I wasn't convinced before I was then. Sleek sharp and comfortable all around would be the best way to describe. I completely agree with the other reviewers as well. ,
2013,28-02-2013,1,0.4927,5,You can't go by the EPA mileage rates because that doesn't take into consideration the option to drive in Econ mode to increase fuel efficiency.,
2013,08-03-2013,1,0.7783,4.625,The car gets very good gas mileage for around town (average 34.1 with a/c running most of the time and usually in normal mode).,
2013,26-05-2013,1,0,4.75,After test driving the Ford Fiesta and checking out the Veloster and Civic SI he decided on a cr-z and we are happy he did.,
2013,09-07-2017,1,0.4556,5,its by far the best looking car made in a long time not counting high priced cars that nobody can afford. the manual transmission the only proper way to drive a car. that cvt and flappy paddles are a joke on all cars. all hail the stick!,
2013,29-07-2013,2,0,4.875,     The new 2017 Honda Ridgeline has come out now and Honda was able to give us something new and take away something at the same time.  They gave us a truck that resembles most other trucks on the market they kept what works from the original Ridgeline and added some new things to pay for.  It's not cool to have to pay for features once standard equipment ie AWD and electric rear window.  The new Ridgeline is nice but now since I have taken 3 years to get to like my Ridgeline I like the old style just a little better.  Honda fell short on knocking my socks off with its new design new colors and new features.  The one thing Honda never falls short on is quality and the fact that Hondas just work and work well. I will eventually own a new Ridgeline why not they are a great vehicle but my 2013 Ridgeline is still a great truck.  It runs well looks good drives the best quiet and reliable. It's a Honda.,

2013,17-04-2014,3,-0.4724,5, when you look at the stats and specs,
2013,13-08-2014,3,0,5,that this car is givin its misleading. saying its not fast enuf or the gasmilage isnt what its supost to be i must disagree i got the 6mt and was told 31-38 thats not what im getting im up to 43 avg. and the 0-60 they claim im blowing it away and i havent even givin it all its got its about 6 sec witch is faster then any car in its price range the sport and eco buttons make a huge diffrence and the s+ gives you something extra too. i think if honda and other companies would have tested it properly they would have sold more. i wasnt going to buy it after looking up online reviews but after testing it i couldnt refuse its far more then they give it credit,

2013,01-10-2013,4,0,4.875,I drove all of the smaller pickups in the market and found the Honda Ridgeline to be the right size 4 wheel capability smooth riding relatively quiet and fully capable for what I need in a pickup. Getting the Honda reliability was a plus. We drove it around town for the first 4K miles and it was a pleasure driving it in an urban setting easy to park great for those occasional trips to buy furniture and good looking enough for date nights. You guessed it I don't miss my F-150.  50000 + miles later and my Ridgeline is still driving like new. Have only done the scheduled maintenance including regular oil changes and new transmission oil. The tires are still great the truck runs straight nothing leaks and I still love driving it each day. ,
2013,26-10-2013,4,0.9828,4.75,    Since I have purchased this vehicle a new designed model is about to be launched and I'm anxious to see it up close. I have grown accustomed to the ugly original look and even though I think Honda missed the mark on a NEW design it's still a Honda and it will always run better than it looks.,
2013,12-03-2014,4,0.5859,4,Look up what actual drivers are posting for what they are getting and you will be surprised.,
2013,24-02-2017,4,-0.2755,4, I highly recommend getting  a bed cover.  It will help with the mileage.  That is pretty much the only thing about the vehicle that I wish was better.  I love all the storage.  You give up some getting a four door short bed but the truck (under the bed) is huge.  I was able to put a table saw in it with plenty of room.  The fold up rear seats are great too.,
2014,10-11-2013,1,0.8271,4.5,You get used to the gasoline engine noise in the background especially when you realize the engines primary purpose is running the generator for the powerful electric drive motor. And over 40 mph the gasoline motor is capable of 45 mpg.,
2014,08-01-2014,1,0,4.625,I had one very minor warranty claim which was handled promptly and courteously by the dealer.,
2014,20-02-2014,1,0,1.875,This is a great vehicle for the suburbanite who needs to make the occasional Home Depot run and may need to haul a smaller RV trailer.,
2014,22-04-2014,1,0.6901,4.875, I've had my base Hybrid for a month and put a little over 2K miles on it. It's been amazing so far. I've averaged about 48 mpg so far in mixed driving which probably be higher if temps didn't drop below freezing which caused me to average about 36 mpg on my current tank. Handling is good for a big sedan and it feels like it has as much power as my former '04 Accord EX-L V6 Navi. Brakes are smooth and linear unlike the jerky brakes found on the Prius's I've rented. Seats are supportive and comfortable and the interior fit and finish is quite good. I find the infotainment system to be decently intuitive. The base audio system is ok though not great. ,
2014,20-05-2014,1,0.8172,5,The power it has at take off it's like if it were a v6 engine.,
2014,02-09-2014,1,0,4, I've had my Ridgeline for about 18 months now.,
2014,12-01-2015,1,0.9778,4.75, I had to wait 2 months to get the model I wanted (2014 Touring) but I am very happy with this car.,
2014,10-07-2015,1,0.6858,3, Once my civic hit 99k I decided it was time to upgrade comfort power and size.  When I saw the mileage ratings of 45/50 and read the reviews I was hooked.  I purchased the car about 6 months ago and have driven 21K miles.  AVG mpg since the start is 38.5.  OK I realize I drive a little faster than most (75 avg on hwy) and I also realize that I purchased the car in the dead of winter (which I am told will adversely affect mileage) but 10mpg under??.  The ride is great the comfort is great and overall I am happy with the vehicle.  Is the car worth the extra money to upgrade to the hybrid? not unless you keep it for 500000 plus miles.  Also I am having a couple of issues. 1 - There are about 25 paint chip marks on the very front of the hood I never had this with any vehicle I have purchased (this is my 12th new purchase).  2 - There is a knocking sound on the passenger side when starting out or stopping that has been there from day 1 it almost sounds like a spring popping.  I mentioned it when I was in for an oil change at the dealer but was told a mechanic was not available.  So I just made an appointment a week from now so we will see.,
2014,05-10-2015,1,0.9366,5,It doesn't drive like the traditional hybrid (no hesitation) unless you put it in econ mode. ,
2014,13-06-2016,1,-0.8291,3, My dealer hounds me about getting the transmission fluid changed for a whopping $167. I've never had a vehicle in which this was even suggested by a dealer. The owner's manual says there are indicator lights to show what is needed. I've never seen any indicator to suggest changing any fluid other than engine oil. It may just be that my dealer is trying to scam me.,
2014,09-11-2013,2,-0.0772,4.75, I love this car! I had the 2010 accord leased and bought the new hybrid it's sleek style and economical gas mileage is my fav features.,

2014,09-09-2016,2,0,5, I have had the Honda ridgeline RTS for three years. I have a dog and allergies. The bed of the truck really helps me when I am traveling with my dog. It also helps when I just need to transport something small like a chair or table. I love the hidden trunk space and the valet key! I am a female and ALL of my friends just love this truck. I think that maybe your marketing was aimed at the wrong audience. I really really think that you guys may have mis-marketed this truck! I expected to lease or buy a Honda ridgeline forever . . . but now I am considering the Jeep wrangles. I do not want a traditional man's truck. I look at your 2017 Honda ridgeline and just feel so bad. It is not even a semblance of it's original great self. Won't you reconsider? I saw one truck (someone else driving it); looked and looked for another one in my town and months later saw another one. I was hooked! Since I have bought my truck I now see them quite frequently!,
2014,26-05-2017,2,0.9009,4, Bought show room virgin new a black beauty SE. The head liner falls down 6 months old now 2.5 yrs old roof down for 3rd time. Honda Service tells me black vehicles do not do well in the south. The adhesive is not so good in the heat. Tell me my new truck is the only Honda ever to have the head liner fall down repeatedly. they now say someone is pulling it down. I have no children dog... I am the only one that uses the truck for a short commute to & fro work. Its a sport vehicle never used as a truck. no one has ever been in the back seat. Beware Honda says way too hot for Black in the south. Your roof will fall down. I am an automotive engineering professional disappointed in the Honda service incompetence.... no fix and its still under warranty (WTF?). I will never purchase a Honda again after 9 Hondas. This is Hondas service attitude (Columbia South Carolina).,
2014,27-12-2013,3,-0.6249,4.75,Love it! Thanks honda for an even better car!,
2014,07-01-2014,3,-0.5719,3.125, I bought this vehicle because of the large amount of storage and cubbies and smooth test drive. I'm happy to say that's what the purchased vehicle delivers. Unfortunately it falls short in nearly every other area. ,
2014,12-08-2014,3,0.9848,5, My husband was dying to get back to a stick shift. I refuse to buy anything with less than 35 MPGs avg. We both wanted fun comfort and style. Answer: the CR-Z. It took us two years to be able to buy one since we do need one car with more space but as a second vehicle for commuting and weekend errands it's perfect. We had to work out a weekly trade-off to avoid fighting over who got to drive it. It took a little getting used to because it is small but it hugs the road beautifully. The side mirrors are built smart for better visibility and even the base model includes a Google Glass back-up camera (I miss it when driving our other car!). Bottom line: we LOVE it!,
2014,10-10-2014,3,0.9117,5,Whilt the base Hybrid is essentially a EX model the deletion of the moonroof is a bit puzzling. I orginally wanted a EX-L Hybrid but ended up buying the base because I couldn't get the navigation system with it (must step up to touring) unlike on the conventional EX-L. I added leather to my base Hybrid and still saved almost $4000 over buying the EX-L as the my dealer was willing to negotiate for the base and not the EX-L. ,
2014,02-04-2016,3,-0.6326,5, This is NOT for the manly man who needs a macho truck.,
2014,07-01-2014,4,0.7572,5,I was getting 45-47 in the summer but I'm finding my mileage closer to 38-40 when the temperature gets below freezing. I think the gasoline blend has a lot to do with that. I have been able to get over 50 but I live on a hill so the overall mileage reflects that. The performance is excellent. Much like an Acura TL service car I drove when I owned my MDX.,
2014,18-02-2014,4,0.3612,5,I would never think its that powerful and I thought I would lose power for fuel economy but I was wrong this car has more power than the 2010 Honda.,
2014,31-03-2014,4,0.9591,5,Powerful smooth and very efficient powertrain; roomy and comfortable interior; and the blind spot camera (Lane Watch) is pretty useful. ,

2014,24-09-2014,4,0.5719,3.125, I've had my hybrid Ex-L for about a month now. I regularly get around 53 mpg city but my highway mpg runs around 37 even with the econ button on (I have a bit of a lead foot). The mpg is effected more in cold weather than traditional cars. I love how I can put it in electric mode for short trips if the battery is charged enough its perfect for running to the grocery store. Like another reviewer mentioned the battery rarely gets fully charged but does well enough.,
2015,16-03-2015,1,0.3089,4.75,"However I was unaware of just how disappointingly choppy the car's ride would be when the it's software switches between electric engine and gas engine... especially when driving faster than 40 MPH at constant speed. I failed to realize this during the original test drive because I only drove it on the freeway for about one mile (and in heavy afternoon traffic). In short (whether using cruise control or not) the 2015 Accord Hybrid will intermittently pause and then surge whenever the electric engine disengages from action at speeds north of 35-40 MPH. This is both annoying and disconcerting since it results in a choppy ride. I took my new Accord Hybrid to the dealer service folks twice for this problem. The first time I was told to stop using the ECON mode if I wanted a smoother ride. The second time I insisted on speaking with the service tech.  Here's the exact verbiage from the service ticket: ""NFP test drove the vehicle and verified customers concern. Took snap shots during the event of the PGM-FI system... etc.. After review of all the snap shot data was sent it was determined that it is the normal operation of this vehicle."" That's a pretty poor response from Honda. I've always be partial to Honda products... but with the Accord Hybrid: Let the buyer beware.",
2015,17-07-2015,1,0,2, I bought the new 2015 Accord Hybrid for it's fuel economy and it that aspect of the car does not disappoint.,
2015,27-05-2016,1,0.438,2,1. In the first 60 days twice the vehicle abruptly stopped on the road with multiple error messages related to battery overheating and engine overheating. On both occasions dealership could not offer much resolution. In an oil change exercise the software was patched and the issue went away. ,

2015,22-01-2015,2,-0.6718,4, First if all entertainment system sounds great DD player is essentially useless other than to play CD's will not save anything. Playing with flash drive is cumbersome I bought an iPod Nano and it is infinitely easier. Honda needs some new engineers this is unacceptable. Dealer shrugged his shoulders so I'll try once more then contact Honda directly. Car handles great reasonably quiet when not accelerating (pronounced whine). Mileage very temperature dependent heater is electric heater warming cab no EV.   ,
2015,27-09-2015,2,0.2942,5," I bought this car for commuting to work.  Now my wife wants to take it as much or more than I do.  Sporty look.  Enough cargo for both of us to get away for a few days.  Gas mileage is better than advertised especially in ECON mode.  The only issues I have are legroom is a bit tight for me (I am 6'3"") and the radio does not pair without a cable.  Otherwise the car is absolutely great!  I see a lot of Prius on the road but would buy 10 CRZ's before I'd buy one of those.",
2015,20-02-2016,2,-0.5574,3,2. The gas mileage: Occasionally my vehicle has given me 43+ mileage in the first 6 months and started dropping to 40 miles. However since my oil change and couple of filter change service the mileage has dropped to 35-36 miles/gallon. Have discussed with dealership with very little resolution,
2015,10-08-2016,2,0.9134,5, I fell in love with the CR-Z the moment I laid eyes on it. I loved the 80's sports car look (which is based on the old CR-X) and the very modern interior design. Better yet the car is economical with crazy good gas mileage. ,
2015,07-09-2016,2,-0.3401,1, It has been a year since I bought this car. It has been nothing but trouble within first month and a year later still facing issues. ,
2015,07-02-2017,2,0,5,The reviews of this car don't do it justice- this car is not intended to be a sports car. It's meant to be a hybrid that's fun to drive and performs like a sports car and on that count it passes with flying colors. One complaint I frequently saw is about rear and side visibility. I've had no problems once I got used to the car.,
2015,09-04-2015,3,0.6044,5,A few months have passed since the original post.  Still enjoying the CRZ; it has exceeded my expectations.  The only issue I have had is connecting my iPhone to play music.  Worked for a while but now I am unable to get a connection.  Wireless would have been a better alternative.  Otherwise very pleased overall.,

2015,07-10-2015,4,-0.9147,4,Overall though I love Honda and owned a Civic for 16 years that ran trouble free for ~200K miles would highly discourage anyone looking to buy a Honda Hybrid car based on above experience.,
2015,01-05-2016,4,0,3,3. ACC(Adaptive Cruise Control) & FCW(Forward Collision Warning): On multiple occasions in the last 12 months both these features use to malfunction based on Radar obstruction and in the last 10 days they have stopped working including the disabling of regular cruise control operations. This has made my long drive to work a manual exhausting effort. Dealership that inspected has advised of expensive diagnostics and recalibration which I am not sure if I truly should pay for.,
2016,19-06-2016,1,0.3182,5, The CRZ is the only hybrid that comes with a manual 6-speed transmission. It has gears!!! Compared to other hybrids that have CVTs that kill hp torque and driving fun.,
2016,23-05-2016,2,0.9825,5,It is now Feb 2017 and after 6 months I still feel the same way about what my original review in July 2016.,
2016,23-08-2016,2,-0.7159,5, My wife & I wanted a two-seater with some cargo space that's fun to drive and doesn't cost too much. This Honda CRZ hybrid is exactly what we were looking for. We test drove several roadsters and none came close in terms of purchase price and fuel economy. With its 3 driving modes we have it all from 36 mpg average (1/3 city & 2/3 hwy) to thrilling performance. In the sport mode this is a little rocket ship and handles as well as other roadsters we tested. For around $21000 (new) it's a great value--nice & comfortable interior attractive gauges and decor good entertainment system w/ bluetooth plenty of cargo room great handling. Road and engine noise are a bit loud but that's a part of being a roadster. Other cars we own are Ford Explorer Mercedes R350 & a Prius so this fits in very nicely with our collection. We would have liked this to be a convertible. But all things considered that's a small sacrifice. This rocket ship is just plain fun to drive without bleeding my pocket book. MPG would be better if we drove more in ECO mode but that defeats the point of having a roadster!,
2017,29-01-2017,1,0.984,5, We looked at the Tahoe Armada and Highlander and the pilot won us over on its winning combination of performance economy advanced AWD system and value. We travel to Vermont often on narrow private roads that are not always plowed well. Honda's i-VTM is really the Acura SH-AWD with torque vectoring. On dry roads it helps some but it is also a winner in the deep snow shifting power left to right as well as front to back as needed. Really great system. The cargo space in this rig is HUGE especially with part or all of the 3rd row down. The cargo area is equivalent is size to the Tahoe and more usable as the load floor is lower.  The acceleration is decent and I like the intake noise as the VTEC kicks in at higher revs. Without flogging it I've seen high 20s for MPG on the highway. Overall over the first 1500 miles we've gotten 23 MPG combined.  The 9 speed feels a bit weird around 4th or 5th gear but it isn't a big deal. The push button shifter took some getting use to but after a day we were used to it and it wasn't a big deal. I really liked the looks of the Tahoe but for the money (and even not considering the money) the Pilot is an unbeatable combo of utility economy and performance.,
2017,13-02-2017,1,0.9746,3, Overall I am happy with the Honda Pilot and would recommend.  However because of some of the items noted below I am not able to give a rating higher than 3 stars.,
2017,02-03-2017,1,0.7351,4,I really wanted to purchase the EX-L trim with V6. But ending up purchasing the Touring trim.  With respect to the EX-L trim.  Why is Honda forcing the consumer to select between one of:  Honda Sense navigation or rear entertainment?  These three options can not be combined on the EX-L.  A Honda salesman tried to convince me that built-in navigation is no longer necessary with addition of Andriod Auto and Apple CarPlay.  If you have ever traveled to rural areas without cellphone data coverage you'll understand the need for built-in navigation.,
2017,12-03-2017,1,0.9021,5, I bought the Touring model because the Elite model did not have the right side camera only blind spot indicator in both mirrors.  I would say the blind spot indicator in the left hand side would be handy but prefer the camera on the right.  There are so many things I love about this Pilot that I can't pick out one favorite.  Engine Idle stop at a light is awesome.  Push button shift is fabulous.  Navigation takes some time to figure out the ins and outs but it is great.  Love the Adapative Cruise Control and Lane departure warning.,
2017,22-03-2017,1,0.9915,5, Internet online purchase is the best way to buy any 2017 Honda Pilot!,
2017,22-03-2017,1,0.6908,3,"The 'Honda Lane Watch'.  If this is such a great feature why doesn't the Elite have two cameras (both driver and passenger sides)?  Instead the Elite adds real 'Blind Spot' detection feature.  I would much rather have the blind spot detection with large illuminated icon on the side mirrors instead of the 'Honda Lane Watch'.  If the majority of your turns are in the right lane you will quickly understand the annoyance (don't need to see grass or sidewalk).  An illuminated icon on the side mirror is quick for the driver to process.  Whereas the ""Honda Lane Watch"" requires the driver to remove their eyes from the road and look at the in dash monitor to determine if there is a car in the lane.  The main point of safety features is to help the driver focus on the road.  Which ""Honda Lane Watch"" doesn't because you have to watch live video feed and make decision.",
2017,31-03-2017,1,-0.905,5, I've owned/driven Hondas for the last 25 years and have always been satisfied with fit finish reliability and safety and I have come to take these things for granted from Honda.  The point is up to now I was just satisfied but the 2017 Pilot has blown me away with seemingly all the things I didn't even know I needed.  I've never owned a vehicle with remote start but now I use it almost daily.  I love the auto door unlock/lock feature.  In the past when leaving my vehicle my hands were full and I used to have to fumble for the door lock FOB and juggle packages.  Now I just walk away and the vehicle takes care of itself.  When I return I don't need to unlock the doors I just grab the door handle and the doors unlock.  Don't buy navigation just use Android Auto it integrates well with all of the other Audio options.  I know these are just minor things but the cumulative effect of all the minor design improvements are going to WOW you and make you appreciate your decision to buy this car.  It's fun to drive looks good and gets good mileage.  I don't think you will regret it.,
2017,04-05-2017,1,0.9718,5, I have been a loyal Acura owner for years.  But after drving the MDX  I liked the features and looks on the Pilot better.  Could not Justify the 9700 difference in price.  If the the price was the same id still by the Pilot.  Only 1000 miles so far but i love the Pilot.,
2017,03-06-2017,1,0.3612,2, This is our 4th New SUV in 13 years.  This is the first one I have ever had to take to the dealer with a problem before 70000 mile.  This car developed a clunk in the front drive train or suspension at about 3000 miles.  Of course the service department can find nothing wrong with it.  Honda is behind it's competitors when it comes to interior design.  Less leg room in the front driving compartment controls are dated other companies have lessen to their focus groups.  I think Honda miss the boat here.  Blind spot camara is useless who looks at their center screen when changing lanes.  Really missed the boat here when comparing them to there competitors.  To many bad interior design features to mention.,
2017,07-06-2017,1,0.8978,5, The Honda Pilot is a very well built high quality automobile.  It drives good rides good and is very quiet on the road.  It is filled with technology----almost to a fault.  It will take my wife and me some time to learn all of its features.  It is very smooth and is getting very good gas mileage.  I can't imagine that any SUV being made could have more features than does the Pilot.  It is also very roomy.  It also has all wheel drive and stability control so is very sure footed in rain or snow.,
2017,09-06-2017,1,0.7906,5, Good value for the money,
2017,19-01-2017,2,0.9114,5, I really like the design of the 2017 Honda pilot.   It's attractive on the outside  comfortable on the inside.   A few concerns though.  The rear seats could be a little more comfortable but at least they are not used every day.   It also seems like the heat takes a while to really kick in which was not what I was expecting for a brand-new vehicle but perhaps because it's a large space it takes a while.   Also the Bluetooth has not consistently worked.   Overall a five star car though great in snow and ice and very good gas mileage for this type of vehicle.,
2017,20-01-2017,2,0.6696,5, Sporty spacious good fuel economy is a great family car,
2017,15-03-2017,2,0.882,4, With my growing family and constant trips to a mountain cabin we needed more space that we had in our old Forester but couldn't give up solid AWD and high clearance to make it.  The Pilot does this well--good power clearance and traction with a ton of room.  It's a larger vehicle though so if you put things on your roof you'll need to be tall or carry a step stool since there are not good external steps.  I'm not a fan of the roof rails for attachments as it means I can't reuse my older Thule setup.  Finally I'm not crazy with the entertainment system--it can be easy to get lost in different contexts.  For example switching from listening to the radio to   Spotify is a multistep process that can take some getting used to.,
2017,12-04-2017,2,0.9673,1, It doesn't feel like an SUV.  It's like a car combined with a mini van. Loose steering slow draggie start up sits lower so not able to treat like SUV. Lower interior limits hauling anything large.  Seller was very limited on the knowledge of the vehicle and until I received the owner's manual I didn't realize the limitations on the stereo/interface system that doesn't meet my needs.  Irresponsible information from the seller caused ordering of wrong equipment.  Overall disappointed with this vehicle and wish I had looked elsewhere. Nothing great about this car for the money spent.,
2017,10-05-2017,2,-0.8036,5, We test drove the 2017 EX-L 4WD but ended up buying the 2WD instead.  There was no noticeable difference.  And given the area we live in we'd rather save the money.,
2017,27-05-2017,2,-0.9411,4, Good comfort and expected performance since I was a 2005 Pilot owner. New features such as back up camera and passenger side camera for lane change and blind spot are great. Too bad it didn't include driver's side as well. Side mirrors fold back on this model is something that I wish was electronically adjustable as I fold them back every day manually. Plenty of room and great console. Plenty of compartments on the doors and back area's. Love the hatchback open ability from the key ring. Easy to open and close without having to do it manually. Touch unlock on the doors and key less start a big plus. Getting used to the higher ride for distance estimating in front takes a little getting used to. You can't really see the front of the car to judge how close you are. Bluetooth match up fine for our two Android phones however the interface for playing music from our phones doesn't have the flexibility for selecting songs albums or playlists that the phone does. Using google maps from the phone interface works fine.,
2017,09-06-2017,2,0.4159,4, Needs USB ports in back seat area. Needs volume control. LKAS needs to be better. ACC is a really great feature but should be smoother. I think I would like to be seen more in a Jeep Rubicon or even a  Jeep Grand Cherokee but the Pilot beat it the highlander and the Explorer in all the measurable categories.,
2017,13-06-2017,2,0.6041,2, I know I should love this car and I know old ladies shouldn't swear.  But I freaking hate this car and wish I had bought an older model which is sad because I haven't bought a new car in 13 years!  1)Auto Stop - if you are stopped for a tiny amount of time the engine will shut off and restart when you move the steering wheel or take your foot off the brake.  IT IS UNNERVING!!  When I bought the car the dealer said you can turn that irritation off but he meant you have to turn it off every time you start the car.  2)The freaking BEEPING - you can turn the incessant beeping off and risk backing into a brick wall if you're not used to the camera or you can leave it on and have it annoy the living @!,%& out of you - when you're backing out of an underground spot with nothing for 2-3' in any direction when you're rounding a tight turn on your daily trip home (??????) or when it thinks you're too close to a car in front of you - I'm not yet dead I'm not blind if I'm that close to a car in front of me it's because I WANT TO BE!!  3)The incredibly stupid feature that unlocks all the windows - my boyfriend says it's unlocking the doors then holding the unlock button down.  However it happened to me when I LOCKED the car and not sure what got pressed as the key jostled in my purse.  In any case who EVER wants all their windows opened unless they're IN THE CAR?  I live in Seattle - rain rain and more rain twice now in my car completely accidentally.  In summary of the features TOO $%^&& MUCH! When I want a driverless car I'll get one til then LET ME DRIVE THE CAR!!!!!  And finally I don't know if it's suspension or what but going over  speed bumps or into a big profile driveway  (dozens of times a day for most people) is  detrimental to your spine.
2017,18-07-2016,3,0.9414,5, I have to say being in the car business and working for another brand that pick up isn't available took me a long time to decide which one would be the best hands down mid size pick up truck out there if you are in the market for a midsize pick up truck take 20 minutes of your time  and go to the nearest Honda dealer and test drive the new 2017 Ridgeline and you will understand what I'm talking about you basically getting a Acura Pick up truck a step a head of Tacoma Frontier Colorado etc! You will not be disappointed!!! Good luck!,
2017,19-07-2016,3,0.9823,5, Had this truck for three weeks and already taken it on a long haul trip. 26mpg was surprisingly good.  We love the vehicle and at the moment I can't come up with a criticism.  Our first truck and first Honda!,
2017,22-07-2016,3,0.9901,5, **Update after 1 year - still enjoying the vehicle and after a year of combined highway and city driving looks like 43 MPG is about average. In the city at 20-50 MPH stop and go you can easily get 49 or 50 MPG but on the highway over 70 brings you back to reality. With all factors combines this is still the best car I have ever owned.,
2017,09-08-2016,3,0.8271,5, I liked the looks of the Tacoma and Colorado quite a bit more than the Ridgeline but after test driving all three there was no doubt in my mind which one I would buy. If not the comfort then the tech if not the tech then the active safety equipment. I absolutely love the fold up rear seats and the trunk bed well worth the slightly higher bed height,
2017,15-08-2016,3,0.938,5,I love this truck.,
2017,18-08-2016,3,0.8705,5,"I was new to hybrids in 2013 and purchased a 2013 Hyundai Sonata and loved that vehicle right off the bat and was sold on hybrids. With that car I averaged 38 mpg on the highway and was thrilled that I could go over 500 miles before having to fill up. The argument at the time was the hybrid cost more and based on mpg it would take you X years to break even. While this might be a logical value/$ spent thought I for one loved the fact that I was doing my part to help with the ecology and consuming less gas which made me feel good and I was sold. While I loved this first hybrid I was keeping an eye out for Honda's latest model waiting the entire 2016 model year for the 2017's which have just begun arriving at dealerships as I am a long time Honda fan ( have owned 4 or 5 Honda vehicles). From a ""regular guy"" point of view there is almost nothing about this car I do like like from the fantastic mpg to the great audio system to elegant interior. So far I am averaging 46 mpg combined and an thrilled to see my driving range to empty is about 700 miles. The mpg highway is an interesting number as it never states at what speed was the mpg highway determined. On a recent trip I set the cruise to 70 mph on mostly straight roads and after 2 hours of driving the mpg was listed as 42 mpg. I suspect if I drove 65 mph or 60 mph the mpg might have gotten closer to the published rate but who would drive that speed :-). The only issue I noticed is with Apple Car Play which acts strange at times with accepting phone calls and instances in which there seems to be a software tug of war between Honda car software and Apple as to which product should control a feature.When I do have an issue rebooting the phone does nothing and it requires me to turn off the car then retry which corrects the problem. The car is very very well built and feels more like a Lexus than a hybrid sedan. As I have only had the car for 4 days barring something totally out of the blue and unexpected I would highly recommend purchasing this vehicle and forget the extra cost/how many years to recoup argument and enjoy the ride! (Update 7/26/16) - Resolved the carplay issue as being caused by using both Carplay and Bluetooth at the same time - use one or the other but not both together. On another note I achieved 50.8 mpg in the city by driving with caution and playing with the gas pedal as Hybrid owners will understand what I am referring to. I am not up to 44 mpg combined over 6 days.",
2017,04-09-2016,3,0.8555,5, Traded in my 2016 Tacoma TRD-Offroad Double-Cab Long-Bed truck to get the new Ridgeline.  I was forced to down-size after moving across the country to a house with a crowded garage.  My F150 just barely fit in our garage and leaving it outside isn't an option due to the brutal sun and hail storms of Colorado.  I had to choose between the Tacoma and the Colorado truck when I down-sized at the time.  Definitely wasn't thrilled with either option but the Tacoma edged-out the Colorado.  My Tacoma (and the Colorado) have lack-luster acceleration.  Driving the Tacoma to work and back on not-so-wonderful roads was punishing at times.  Sure the Tacoma is a great off-road vehicle but it needs much better manners to be a daily driver.  I could go on about the Tacoma but I'll stop here.  The 2017 Ridgeline I was a little skeptical about but I was really wanting to find a better mid-sized truck option.  When the Ridgeline was available in my area for a test drive I had to try it out.  My wife had a 2013 Honda Pilot that we really liked and I knew this new truck had the latest version of the engine from the Pilot.  Wow! What a difference!   Smooth quiet powerful and much roomier inside the cabin.  My son couldn't sit in the back of my Tacoma as his head would be touching the roof of the cab.  The Ridgeline has plenty of head room for my son and in spite of the really cool stadium rear seating in the Ridgeline he still has inches of head room to spare.  The Ridgeline has already delivered as high as 30MPG for me on the highway and I can average 25-26MPG in mixed driving (I do use the ECON mode about half the time).  The lowest I've seen it get while driving in the mountains was a tad over 22MPG.  This is using the lower octane gas (85).  The ride is smooth just a little stiffer than our Pilot due to have a suspension more suitable for a truck.  The handling is awesome.  The AWD and suspension made it a fun vehicle to drive on the twisty mountain roads.  In fact the AWD is full-time torque-vectoring very much like what you would get in a Subaru.  Before looking into the Ridgeline I assumed it would be FWD by default and then the rear wheels kick-in when needed but not so...  We will be pulling a camping trailer later with the Ridgeline (probably one that weighs around 3200lbs as the max towing capacity is 5000lbs also a trailer brake controller will be installed on the Ridgeline) and I will report on how that goes.   The only thing about the Ridgeline that I find a little annoying is that the brake peddle is a little mushier than what I'm used to.  BTW...this truck is fast and highly responsive!,
2017,11-09-2016,3,0.9813,5, The hwy mileage has been as high as 31 mpg.  Mostly at 27 to 29 mpg hwy. Combined mileage 23 to 27.  Way better than my 2006 and 2012 Ridgeline.  I just wish all the RTL models had the sliding rear window.  This model was a great value at $37000. March 2017. Update.  Just took a 5600 mile road trip south and west to Arizona.   Average mileage was 26 mpg. Many speed limits were 80 mph.  Great truck.  Mileage on vehicle now 14000.,
2017,12-09-2016,3,0.3612,5, I bought my Ridgeline about 2 months ago when they first came out and I am In Love!!! This is my first truck and 2nd Honda (06 Honda Accord) and I have found the perfect truck for me. I live in the city and just need a truck on weekends and moving stuff once in a while. This is perfect the Ridgeline is so quiet and drives like a SUV. I sometimes forget that I am driving a truck. Gas is not an issue I have to fill it up once a week if that. the technology is great. Apple Carplay Bluetooth Navigation rear view and side view cameras its all there! the Inside is comfortable quiet and has tons of storage space. When I am stopped at a stop light people stare so being one of the first to drive around in one of these is pretty cool too. Highly recommend this truck for people like me that dont need a big Truck for their everyday lives but for the people that drive to the office back and forth Monday through Friday but need that extra truck space every once in a while.,
2017,24-09-2016,3,0.8951,5, The truck has great visibility features handling and comfort.  It combines the feel of driving an SUV or crossover with a bed.  If I wanted a semi I'd buy one.  So the people that feel that it's 'not a real truck' - whatever enjoy your 3 mpg and stepladder mounted to the side.  You haul the same amount as I do in all likelihood...  but yes I might want something larger if I was towing a yacht  or megacamper or concrete or something.  Then consider a megatruck.,
2017,19-10-2016,3,-0.3324,5, I went through Tacoma Canyon Ridgeline and Colorado. Exactly in that order. Money wise Colorado is your best but it's also the worst in terms of design handling and overall quality. Canyon is just little better but still far inferior to Tacoma. Both Colorado and Canyon are example how not to design interior of small tuck imo it's just horrible. Tacoma low sitting position is beyond awkward and the best off road capability is not sell option for me in Florida where I live. I was surprise how good Ridgeline stands among others - roomy interior very good quality fit and finish SUV like ride and this bed trunk where I'm diving so very often for my tools. I have bed where I can lay flat 4x8 and dual action tailgate to dive into the trunk. For me bed trunk is huge advantage 'cos any tool box installed on bed render it somehow useless. Ridgeline is not perfect ( which truck is ? ) I found quite annoying that rear cab doors can't be fully open to 90 deg.,
2017,20-10-2016,3,0.4017,5,"Update: I've put 12000 plus miles on my Ridgeline in the first 6 months. From Colorado to Atlantic Beach where this truck really shines is on long cross country drives.  Crossing the Kansas prairie with the adaptive cruise control set on 77 I averaged 27.8 MPG. The Lane Keeper Assist technology takes some getting ""used to"" the first time you feel the truck gently turning the steering wheel in your hands it is a bit unsettling. However this combination of semi autonomous features is most helpful on long interstate  drives. It's comforting to know the truck will not run over that car slowing in front of you and it will help you stay in your lane. This week while getting some service work done I sat in a new sport edition Ridgeline just for comparison. It confirmed my decision to buy the top of the line Black Edition.  One wierd service issue came up for about the last 6 thousand miles I have been hearing  a noise that seemed to be coming from the front suspension the first dealer that performed an oil change could not find anything wrong. After listening to this rattle and getting increasingly annoyed I took it to a second dealer and asked to demonstrate the noise for the technician. He said immediately it sounds like someone left a tool in there. 2 hours later he produced a small penlight flashlight that was found in the radiator support bracket. Since I had never seen the flashlight before and the noise started before it's first service I'm not sure how it got in there. But the noise is gone. ",
2017,05-11-2016,3,0.7705,5, I rarely write reviews of anything I buy so for me to write this review really says something. I have had my Accord Hybrid EXL for 6 weeks and so far I love it. I commute 50 miles round trip per day in stop and go traffic. I absolutely hated driving but now I (almost) look forward to it! The leather interior looks great and is very comfortable. The bluetooth feature and is my favorite. The car's exterior design is very cool and sleek. The ride is extremely quiet and the gas mileage is great. I am actually surprised from other reviews that others are averaging less than advertised. From my calculations I am getting 48-49 mpg but I do drive less aggressively than I used to and keep it on the ECO setting all of the time so that could make a difference for some people. Before I bought this car I did  a great deal of research. Based on my needs it is the perfect car for me. I can't say enough good things about it. If you are in the market for a hybrid I highly recommend this car.,
2017,22-11-2016,3,0.9865,5, I'm 2 months into ownership and absolutely love the Ridgeline RTL-E. It's smooth comfortable and elegant with the alloys running boards chrome and rear tri-fold cover. It's a head turner in pearl white.  This is my first truck and it's everything I will ever need in utility. If you're looking to drive in comfort and have the ability to pick up stuff at Home Depot and could care less about hauling and off road this is more truck then you'll ever need. This truck is well mannered car- like and composed and I love all of the tech features lane departure collision mitigation and the auto hi-beams. Audio has great sound Navigation is great but the touch screen is quirky and takes some getting used to. I think they should change the touch screen going forward. They need to add cooled seats and outside mirror signals as the RTL-E is the top of the line. Lastly the tailgate does not lock; bummer. Overall great truck!,
2017,09-01-2017,3,0.4404,5,The Touring and Elite has 'Engine Stop' feature.  The Honda Pilot isn't a hybrid like Toyota Prius so not sure why Honda engineers felt this feature was necessary.  Really annoying in stop-and-go city traffic.  When you come to a complete stop the engine shuts down.  There is capability to disable 'Engine Stop' but must be disabled each time you start the car.,
2017,08-07-2016,4,0.8596,5, I had narrowed my purchase options  down to 4 door 4 wd compact trucks; Tacoma Colorado and Ridgeline. the first Ridgeline I was able to drive was the Black Edition. I was always leaning toward a Tacoma but I test drove the Tacoma Colorado and Ridgeline back to back. Unfortunately the Tacoma engine- transmission gearing feels wrong on the  highway with the cruise control on the Tacoma had to downshift and was screaming to maintain 70 mph up a small hill. The Ridgeline in contrast feels smooth refined powerful the engine is not screaming to maintain 70 mph up a small hill on the highway.  The Colorado actually finished in second place in my new truck list it feels smaller inside.   I choose the Ridgeline; Honda reliability gas mileage handling & ride. I wasn't sure I was going to like the way it looked from the official photos but when I saw the BE I loved the modern new truck look. This Ridgeline combines the functionality of and takes the place of my Subaru Forester and my old 93 2wd Toyota truck. In my first 500 miles I turned the Econ mode on and got 27 mpg with the adaptive cruise control set at 70 mph. When I switched Econ off and drive normal combined city highway at speeds exceeding 75 mph I still got 24 mpg. I can live with that mpg.  The interior feels large and refined mine has lots of leather and more technological bells  and whistles than I need Adaptive cruise control keyless entry push button start Apple car-play rear camera blind spot warning cross traffic monitor lane  departure warning-correction emergency front collision avoidance braking sunroof power rear slider power everything 540 watt stereo three zone climate control with rear vents Led lights everyplace multiple usb  ports and the best party trick is the truck bed audio system. The Ridgeline Black edition feels like; a luxury car a sports car a big suv and a truck all rolled into one.  I don't plan to go off roading I plan to take long trips tailgate  fill the back seat with grandkids and occasionally haul a full sheet of plywood or a load of mulch. It's early but I love it!,
2017,11-07-2016,4,0.7712,4,Jan 2017 Update:  As a suburban DIY and weekend warrior I am still loving this truck.  Cons I've found are: 1. No power retractable mirrors.  It would be easier to pull into the garage with this simple feature available on the Pilot.  2. The fog lights are not LED (not optional) and don't look very impressive when paired with the awesome LED headlights.,
2017,13-08-2016,4,0.9816,5, It's near perfect. I'm new to Hybrids/EV and almost got the Chevy Volt...but this 2017 is SO spacious and gorgeous. I have the fully loaded touring and the LED lights make a beautiful statement. The car accelerates wonderfully and it is a very stable drive with great turning radius for its size. I'm not 100% in love with the touch screen/navigation because it can be slow at times but it's not bad. The interior is luxurious and I love that the backseat is just as nice as the front in terms of comfort and space. The exterior chrome accents and wheels are very nice and the general shape of the hybrid is sporty but elegant and I highly recommend you get black! :) mileage is great especially for those work commutes involving traffic (quality EV time). GET THIS CAR you won't regret it.,
2017,15-08-2016,4,0.9451,5, Have put about 500 miles on my new Ridgeline which is replacing a 2006 Ridgeline with 210000 miles on it.  Very pleased so far.,
2017,17-08-2016,4,0.7022,5, The redesigned 2017 Honda Ridgeline is a significant improvement over the previous design. I previously owned a 2006 and 2011 Ridgeline but left Honda three years ago to another brand (GMC) due in large part to the prior outdated design  old technology (really no USB port?) etc.     The new Ridgeline has fixed the problems of the past with much improved technology better sound system modern design quiet ride and comfortable handling. The safety features (RTL-E) are impressive perhaps redundant (Lane Keeping Assist vs. Road Departure Mitigation systems). Very pleased with combined city/highway milage (23-24) the ability to put the engine in ECO setting to shut down 2 cylinders when cruising is useful on long trips. Some new things are gimmicky (A/C outlet for tailgating tv and bed sound system) but overall it has received many looks and compliments decent towing and AWD for our rural location.,
2017,15-10-2016,4,0.9918,4, Had looked into hybrids for a while and am glad I held out for the accord hybrid.  I have had the car for 2 weeks and am averaging 46 mpg with a 42 mile commute 1 way.  One day last week I pulled a 53 mpg trip.  Hybrid expense wise: I purchased the trim level I would have purchased had it not been a hybrid which is similarly priced with a non hybrid accord.  I traded in a RAM 1500 that was getting 18 mpg.  The only con is the radio controls: not very intuitive on changing the source through the screen when you have the iPhone connected.  Maybe that is intentional so you use a steering wheel thumb with eyes on the road instead of staring at the radio for sources.  Honda Sensing takes some getting used to.  I shut the lane mitigation off after about 50 miles.,
2018,03-07-2017,1,-0.9211,5, This is my 1st minivan and i love it. Driving is Sporty comfortable and at the same time less noisy when compared to previous years. Technology is user friendly,
2018,05-06-2017,2,0,5, I owned a 2011 Toyota Sienna. It started having too many problems for me to justify keeping it especially considering it's  only 6 years old. I had to replace both sliding door motors driver's door lock front and rear rotors several small engine repairs ($870 worth). I test drove both the Chrysler Pacifica and Odyssey. The Odyssey won hands down. The Pacifica'Stinky styling was too funny for me some of the interior materials seemed very cheaply made and the rear seats and head room were pathetic along with the infotainment system. I picked up my 2018 Odyssey Touring last week. So far owning it has been an absolute joy. The features I love most is the way it drives. It's quick very responsive and the steering feel and control is amazing. It drives much more like a car or sporty SUV than a van certainly tons better than the Sienna. I rides so well too. The seats are amazing for me a 197 lb. 6.0 ft. tall guy and a good amount of headroom even in the second row! The rear seats are just as comfortable as the front unlike the new Chrysler Pacifica that we also test drove. The rear seats were unbelievably uncomfortable in the Pacifica most likely due to less padding for the seat to fit and fold down into the floor. I'd much rather have comfortable seats that don't fold into the floor. The sliding second row seats are also incredible and useful. I have 2 kids and a wife so usually the third row seat isn't occupied. But If it is we still have plenty of room for cargo in the trunk!! The infotainment system is very quick and lag-free also very unlike the sluggish Pacifica infotainment. We didn't get the Elite trim because we don't need the CabinWatch or CabinTalk feature because my kids are grown. We chose the Touring trim over the EX-L mostly for the extra safety features. We love the features especially LaneKeep Assist which definitely adds peace of mind while driving at night or when tired. I honestly have zero complaints with my van so far! If something comes up I'll definitely update my comment. If you want a fun to drive family hauler with impressive features the Odyssey is for you. Definitely worth a test drive!!,
2018,06-06-2017,2,0.9962,5, Traded in my 2002 Odyssey EX with 209700 miles last week for the 2018 EX White Diamond Pearl with Mocha interior. I loved my old one but I had an urge for new technology and comfort. So far I love my new one!! I didn't bother looking at any other Minivan because I knew I wanted another Odyssey. I also really like the styling of this one. 2 weeks and 230 miles of ownership and I've gotten 3 comments  from people saying my van looks nice!! The seats are super comfy and supportive everything on the interior seems high quality and not cheap at all. Practicality is this van's strong point cup holders and storage compartments everywhere!! I hate clutter so I can neatly store and organize all my junk in the door compartments and under the seats. I'm most impressed with how this van drives the steering is a little stiff with good road feel minimal oversteer. along with a buttery smooth transmission gear changes and superbly quiet cabin even at high speed! I'm a huge fan of the gauge cluster...it looks modern and cool but easy to see while not distracting my eyes from the road. My only complaint so far is cosmetic and completely subjective; the wheels. They aren't cheaply made just not a fan of the design. I am planning to upgrade to 19 inch rims. I love my new Odyssey and look forward to driving it on lots of road trips in the future!!,
2018,18-06-2017,3,0.9967,3, I have owned Honda vehicles for years and our old Odyssey was great. We were approaching 150000 miles and loved all the new features of the new design so we purchased one day 1. We love most everything about the van with one glaring exception. We have a toddler in a rear facing car seat in the second row. Now for some strange reason Honda decided not to put a/c vents overhead in this new design. The A/c vents for 2018 were moved down low just behind the front row seats and blow back towards the rear of the van. With this deign children in rear facing car seats can not get air directed directly on them. Now we live in Florida so the heat from the son requires this. Every time we get home my sons back is sweaty. I even went to a Tint shop and had expensive ceramic based tint put all around but to no avail. Yes the tint reduced the heat coming in but you just can't match having a/c coming down directly on you. If you don't have or will never have rear facing seats you will never notice this issue and everything else about this van is great. You may find the 9speed a bit strange at first but I got used to it and now like driving the van vary much. I just can't understand why Honda would not consider the comfort of the most delicate passengers when designing a new van. I can only assume it was some cost cutting reason. By the way you will notice another cost cutting feature in the sound system of the EXL. Note they no longer have speakers in the back of the van. All the sound for the rear of the van comes from one overhead speaker. The second row is fine with this however the third row occupants can barley hear what's playing unless you fade the sound all the way back and turn it up louder than you would normally like. All and all we love the van and we like Honda but honestly the A/C oversight is really bad and we are considering getting rid of it after only 1000 miles.,
2018,18-07-2017,3,0.9732,2," I was one of the first in America to take delivery on my 2018 Honda Odyssey Elite. The dealership had not even been trained on the whole new technology system so i still have no idea to work most of the functions on the computer. I told the general manager of the dealership to have someone at Honda contact me so I could set up a private education session for my wife and I. That has not happened and it has been over a month and a half.  2 weeks ago my 12 year old son grabbed the front grab handle and it came off in his hand as he fell to the ground. Lot's of rattles and noises that our 2 previous Honda Odyssey's never had. Now the ""biggie"" A week ago the rear passenger door window stopped working. Brought it to my local dealership who looked at it and said it was probably the motor. We made an appointment for Monday July 17 2018 at my local dealership to have the window fixed. Today i was told by my dealership to come pick up my van and that the window was not fixed!!??? They told me that Honda USA is well aware of a problem with the rear windows on these new 2018 Odyssey's and that parts are on backorder and Honda has ""no idea"" when the parts will be available!! So I wasted two days of my wife and my time to get my broken van back that is still broken. This new Odyssey has less than 2000 miles on it...and if we could bring it back for a full refund we would run not walk. This van is a piece of $%&(",
