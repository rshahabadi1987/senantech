1990,15-11-2006,4,-0.887,4.5, I bought my 1990 Passat for my first car and I don't regret it.  Petunia May (her name) is an awesome highway car but it is hard to park in tight areas.  Other than that I love it.  I had to do some break repairs to it which cost an arm and a leg but to me that is wear and tear parts.

1993,16-02-2009,1,-0.6486,4.25, I bought one used from a private sale.  It had 100 thousand miles on it when purchased.  It had over 200K miles on it before we turned it in.  The cost of the repairs were worth more than the car when we replaced it. The ride was very smooth as you could ride the highway in third gear and not realize it.  Only major repairs we needed to do was for brakes and muffler.  This was the first Jetta I owned and made me a huge fan of Volkswagens. It made a great family car.  Due to its size was able to park in the school's parking lot very easily amongst all the minivans and SUVs.,

Word to the wise make friends with someone who is familiar with these cars. My mechanic changes my breaks for under $100 [i purchased the brakes] my tires are 20"" run me $123 a piece cash! Shop around and you won't spend so much the dealer over charges EVERYONE KNOWS THAT!!'",

2004,21-05-2010,2,-0.0516,2.75, I purchased an off-lease VW Touareg that was VW certified drove well for 1 year then electrical problems started.  Truck would just die without any lights etc being on.  Since then it has been in and out of Volkswagen for complete electrical failure even VW doesn't know how to fix it.  They claimed it was after-market wiring which is strange because it was a certified used VW.  Anyone looking to buy a used Touareg don't do it you will never be able to drive it and pay almost more than the car is worth fixing it!,

2004,23-05-2012,2,0.3612,2.875,I was just informed by my dealer that to change the liquid cooled alternator would involve 14 hours of labor to pull the engine and cost $2118.00!!,
2004,22-05-2014,2,0.3612,3.875, You will get a love hate relationship with this SUV. It drives great great in the snow has great power. It is fun to drive and looks nice. The SUV has some stupid build designs like the battery is under the drivers seat. Lets talk about how expensive it is to own this vehicle. Replaced thermostat $1200. that right $1200.00 the front part of the car has to be taken off the thermostat is in the front of the engine so you might as well replace water pump and belt. Your going to have problems with the airbags the tire monitoring system. The worst part is the battery drain as I hate a car that wont start. So it gets expensive to own the vehicle. Oh and the brakes that was another $1100.,
2004,07-07-2010,3,-0.624,3.625, The 2004 Volkswagen Touareg V10 TDI is an absolute blast to drive the V10 engine can only be described as a torque monster.  Throw in mid-20's for gas mileage and you have a great package.  But...the thing has been back to the dealership every other month for a host of recurring and random problems ranging from repeated air bag faults to vibrations to interior trim that cracks in cold temperatures to power loss at speed.  Needless to say a great package has been marred by a dreadful reliability record.  Unfortunately I can't tolerate the lack of reliability so I must say goodbye to the torque monster.,
2004,22-08-2010,3,0,4.5,But is horribly expensive to maintain. ,
2004,17-09-2014,3,0,5, I really love this touareg I bought it 6 month ago with 67000 miles and the car runs great after cleaning the injectors it needs only 18-19mpg in the city and 20mpg at the highway in 6 month I had no problem I only checked the car at volkswagen and it was free I payed nothing this is really a excellent luxury SUV the best I ever had and my kids are happy with this car it is the same base and motor like the Porsche Cayenne ,
2004,23-09-2014,3,-0.1999,1.375, Still love the truck after 5 years owning it.  Only 2nd set of tires with a lot of tread left after 75000 mi. 1st set of tired was replaced at 48000mi.  Still original brake. Replaced battery at 70000mi.  One annoying issue was airbag light lit after my wife adjusted driver seat. Check engine light was lit once for no reason but cleared after a visit to the dealer. didn't come back for 2yr but lit again last week. beautiful interior (better than my BMW 5 and MB E class) fit and finish is top notch. gas mileage is poor but not so bad for a performance SUV. feel very safe driving it great road manner very solid no rattling no loose parts.  took to the beach played sand a very fun SUV.,
2004,29-12-2005,4,0.8625,3.5,horsepower ride handling and great in snow,
2004,18-10-2006,4,0.8572,2.25, I have been disappointed with my vehicle since I purchased it. The tire sensor is on regularly even after numerous repairs. The tires wear quickly and are expensive. Rotating every three months is a most. The interior wears poorly also. The door panels garage opener panel have rubbed off from use. The wood look panels have cracked. Not a good buy.,
2004,08-11-2009,4,0,4.875, My car has been in the shop for 64 days now. the 2nd field engineer is being sent out to evaluate the situation. I have been told on 3 separate occasions my car is repaired and ready to pick up and when I get there is does not start. AC has been an issue since day 1. Alignment has also.  I am not a happy VW Touareg owner!  ,

2005,03-03-2010,1,0.8074,4.125, I bought this SUV used and love it so far.  Its true what everyone says about the brakes tires fuel efficiency and service.  My tires were $800 for all 4 and the shop rotates my tires for free anytime i want to.  Same shop tells me the brakes aren't cheap either $600 for ceramic pads up front.  However this truck is solid and safe you will bulldoze through snow and probably won't every hydroplane in the rain.  You will love this truck until you get to the shop(try to stay away from the dealership their labor is super expensive),
2005,26-06-2007,2,0.6369,4.875, I really shopped around before purchasing my Touareg.  My black exterior really gets people's attention and my passengers LOVE the interior.  BUT my tires wore out quickly gas mileage sucks get-up-and- go doesn't exist without putting it in S or manual.  Radio ate my CD can't get it back.  Passenger mirror doesn't always tilt when backing up.  Rubber on inside driver's side door is peeling.  Seat belt dinger... can anyone say ANNOYING?  Automatic windshield wipers can scare the crap out of you on a sunny day... they'll scape across the window without notice.,
2005,10-06-2008,2,0.2942,4.75, I absolutely love this car and can't wait for the V6 diesel to reach the states. I have driven the Touareg V6 diesel (overseas) and all I can say is wow. 30+ mpg and lots of torque. I compare my Touareg to my brothers 2 X5's (both diesel 2006 & 2008). The interior layout of the Touareg is far beyond the BMW. Even my brother agrees. The newer larger X5 is a disappointment compared to the older body style. The Touaregs styling is better than both X5's.  The Touareg coming in as a overweight still handles very well. The suspension does a very good job of keeping the car at it's optimum performance level. The sound of the V8 is quit p;easing. I have gotten 20 MPG on the hwy at 72 MPH.,
2005,24-04-2010,2,0.8955,3.875,The navigation has a lot to be desired. Mine is the 10 CD version. Fuel economy is not bad for it's weight and towing capacity but a little better would be nice. I found driving the Touareg conservatively uses more gas. You got to push it a bit to get the best MPG (at low speeds city).,
2005,14-05-2010,2,0.9166,3.875,The air suspension is a real nice feature. Control layout is as good as it gets. Setting the suspension to comfort makes an interstate ride very comfortable. Offroad capability is second to none. This is the SUV nobody will test. In Europe they are compared to the Land Rover. ,

2005,28-08-2011,3,0.9292,3.25, Same comments as most of the others:  Great highway ride strong V8 performance Best turning radius of any car I have ever owned. Handles very well. Nicely appointed interior comfortable seats.  Downside: the brakes for wear and this car is very difficult to be smooth when driving at very low speeds the brakes grab and the throttle response is jerky. Poor Gas mileage  Overall the car has exceed my expectations and most of the bugs from the 2004 models we worked out. ,

2009,18-09-2015,3,-0.8246,1, I love driving this car... I've even posted glowing reviews on Facebook about how great it drives on the open highway on twisting roads and in the city.   But at 89000 miles I've spent more money on maintenance than I spent in 250000 miles on my last car a Toyota Camry.     Unfortunately the tales of woe on Edmunds seem to be true....  replaced the intake manifold replaced a door handle had many lights burn out replaced water pump thermostat and cooling fans.   And a few other things.    Check engine light is glowing about 20% of the time.     I'm very sad about needing to give up on this car but I can't imagine the coming problems if I hold onto it.    It might work out OK for those who drive fewer miles but I need my car for some long distance trips.   Ultimately reliability trumps performance.      VW really needs to deal with this.     I'll never buy another one.,
2009,21-09-2015,3,0.0018,1, This car drives like a dream. It is the peppiest little car in its class; however at 88000 miles it is a money pit. I am so sad to get rid of this car. It is stylish and performs but I have poured more than $4k into in in 3 years and I am now facing needing to replace the engine because there is no compression. There were no warnings- just kabam. I will NEVER buy another VW.,

2010,28-03-2015,1,0,3.625, I've driven and owned a numerous amount of cars in my life given my constant travels and former business assignments so I can say with certainty that this Tiguan is turning out to be an excellent decision to purchase. I grew up seeing many VWs Mercedes Volvos and Datsun/Nissans as well as Fords that were decades-old still on the road so I knew those brands were the way to go when it came to ownership. ,
2010,11-01-2017,1,-0.6107,1,Style performance.,
2010,19-04-2010,2,0.4939,5, I really like this car with one HUGE exception-every time I back up my brakes screech.  It is not a small squeak but a loud embarrassing screech.  When running errands I have to purposely look for parking spots where I will not have to reverse.  Really inconvenient.  The dealer says it is normal which I find unacceptable.  I see on other forums other VW users are experiencing the same issue.  This will be my last VW and I cannot wait to unload this one when I can.,
2010,30-05-2010,2,0,3.5, Owned a chevy and honda previously went with the Tiguan b/c the manual trans and looks... have had the car just over a year and it's been in the dealer for fixes 3 times (my chevy and honda needed nothing but routine maintenance). People warned me with buying a VW but I was like 'how can it be so bad if so many people have them?'. Well sadly I am finding out. I love the car but never imagined having probs with a car that's only a year old. How can VW shoot for achieving ,1 car sales if they make junk? Well this is definitely my last VW thinking of trading it for a Rav4 before I have to start paying for the repairs. Sorry to say I did have hopes of 6 years with this car.

2010,07-10-2010,4,0,4.375, This is my first VW after owning over 25 new cars. Like quality of body build feels solid. Interior is like Audi quality without the price. Seating is excellent as well as visibility. I am getting consistent 25 mpg combo hwy/city taking it easy with 6K miles to date. Only complaint is brake squeal when backing up after car sits a couple of hours. VW can't or won't resolve and it appears this is common with the brand. Talked with dealership and customer care -say brakes are to specifications so have a nice day. I told them how come I never had this problem with any other vehicles in the past. They say because you never owned a VW before. They make a nice product except for this issue.,
2010,11-11-2010,4,0,3.875,Another sensor is when closing the trunk the entire locking system freezing up- said it is a safety feature nothing wrong with car???,
2010,14-11-2010,4,0.7783,4.5,"Volkswagen has hit a nice mark with the Tiguan since it's a small SUV completely manageable for someone who's below 5'3"" tall. The car has a peppy pick up when on the highway especially if you shift it into Sports mode. This little car can run! It takes a couple of seconds longer to pick up highway speed on the regular Drive shift as compared to the Sports mode but in both gears it responds fast. ",
2010,21-11-2010,4,-0.5518,4.875, This is the third VW I've owned and I love it even more than the others. Nice clean styling combined with easy to use controls and great performance around town make the Tiguan a fantastic vehicle to drive. ,

2012,18-06-2012,2,0.9485,4.875,I would like to have seen more of the european look. It's now more subdued like the honda and toyota. I realize that's what they were going for just would have liked to seen a little more flow in the lines.,
2012,07-06-2013,2,0.4588,5,All of it!,
2012,12-07-2012,3,0,3.625, Great driving and handling.,
2012,13-07-2012,3,-0.34,3,The car has been in three times so far for the same repair and I am doubtful that VW will ever be able to correct the problem.,
2012,16-07-2012,3,-0.4019,3,They go down fine but stop and go when you close them.,
2012,16-07-2012,3,0,4.75, We've had our new VW Bug for about 8 weeks. Made one payment on it. Wish we knew about the window issue prior to purchase! 2 weeks ago traveling at 50mph the driver side window literally EXPLODED... yes I said exploded... sounded like a collision. Called the police as I thought someone may have thrown something that hit the window. Not so. Took to dealer where they prepared to fix the prob only to find that they called people in from Detroit Corperate to have a look see... the next day! Picture and all in hand the fix procedure was on only to find out the glass was backordered. Couple this with rude no-customer service and no reselution my next stop is the AG in the great stae of GA. ,
2012,19-07-2012,3,0.6314,4.5,Hopefully with enough pressure they will speed up a fix. ,
2012,24-07-2012,3,0,4.25,Although the car is a blast to drive I have been experiencing problems with the drivers and passenger windows.,
2012,25-07-2012,3,0,4.5, Just bought the 2012 Beetle on Saturday. Got a good price and loved the style and feel of the car over the Golf I was originally thinking about getting.,
2012,31-07-2012,3,-0.8674,4.875, I researched and negotiated a great deal over the internet with a local dealer.,
2012,10-08-2012,3,0.2006,3.75,very comfy for my 1:45 commute. Tons of trunk space. We have had Audi Volvo etc this is our favorite.,
2012,14-08-2012,3,0,3.25,There is a driver side window issue.,
2012,22-07-2015,3,0,2,It will work afar several attempts.,
2012,25-10-2011,4,0.7535,5,I have a call into the dealer asking for help. I suspect it's the tires. we'll see...,
2012,03-12-2011,4,0,4.75,Took over a month to get from the factory but has been well worth the wait.,
2012,04-12-2011,4,0.9106,4.625, This is my 3rd TDI. I've owned a 2003 Jetta TDI (5 spd) 2010 Jetta Sportwagen TDI (DSG). Neither of the newer models could reach the 47MPG that the 2003 Jetta got. That said the 2010 was a great car (39 MPG) but I've been waiting for the Passat TDI for the size and comfort. Both of which are 5's in my book. I've had the Passat now for 2 weeks and about 1000 miles. Averaging 41.5 MPG with mostly commuting at 70-75 MPH. Very nice car with one exception. At higher speeds the car seems to wander slightly as if you were driving through gusty winds requiring small steering inputs. A bit annoying i might add.,
2012,08-12-2011,4,0.6124,4.125, So far I have 2700 miles and have only filled (16 gal) the tank 3 times (first one on the dealer!).,
2012,27-12-2011,4,0,4.625,will not come up all the way all the time.,
2012,10-12-2015,4,0.7783,1,Like most of the others I have the window issue where it is a pain to get them back up. At first I thought it was some kind of special feature I couldn't figure out but after poking around a bit it seems I'm in good company.,
2013,18-02-2014,1,0.3612,5, Our new Beetle is our 7th VW.,
2013,02-01-2016,1,0.9298,4, 7/4/17 car has 60000 miles and still no problem. It's an awesome little car. If I had to do it again I would buy vw beetle convertible.,
2013,29-02-2016,1,0.6249,5,I did not have a Jetta in mind but the mileage and price were both right so I test drove it and to my surprise liked it a lot despite it being fairly vanilla on the style front.,
2013,03-03-2016,1,-0.4704,5,It rides like a much larger car but is fun to drive and quick in both acceleration and twisty roads and traffic. My wife is very impressed since she drives it to work because of the gas mileage.,
2013,16-02-2017,1,0,5,Gas is premium which one should get 28 city 34 highway. Road noise is as good as hard top. It can get pricy once you start adding options.,
2013,29-04-2014,2,0,4.625,I work as an outside salesperson and was looking for a car that would get great gas mileage and still have some style.,
2013,17-06-2014,2,0.9891,4.25, I bought my 2013 Jetta 2.5 SE with 4000 miles on it four months ago and it now has 15000 miles.,
2013,13-05-2016,2,0.5106,3,Now at 50000 miles the car still runs great. No problems so far and still very happy with my choice.  Still a great little car.,
2013,11-05-2017,2,0.0516,5,I'm avg 28mpg.,
2013,04-06-2017,2,0,5,"The new Beetle TDI is a far cry from our 2003 model with 490000 miles. It still gets 47mpg the new one is not so good but at 41-45 that ain""t bad.",
2013,08-09-2015,3,0.8514,4, I will start with the only thing that could be improved and that is the transmission. I have the DSG transmission and it is great and refined at normal driving speed (15 mph plus) However it is a bit rough when coasting to a stop driving through a parking lot and other slow situations. It seems there is more low end torque than the transmission knows how to handle and when it downshifts from 3rd to 2nd to 1st gear it is not as smooth as other non-diesel non DSG cars the dealer checked the transmission and all was good no defects were found. Everything else this car aces fuel economy is off the charts build quality is what you expect from VW which is excellent no squeaks or rattles the interior materials are solid and not cheap ergonomics are great and I love the no nonsense designs of the controls. The car handles great and the 2.0 turbo diesel has loads of torque which makes passing and merging into a freeway a breeze (no drama it just builds speed) Road noise is better than other cars I've tested on this segment and great for long journeys front seats are very comfortable and there is great leg room for the back occupants (I'm 6' tall). Trunk space is actually surprisingly good and mine came with a first aid kit. When it comes to fuel economy this car is a star especially on the highway I never get less than 550 miles per tank and have gotten as much as 610 in a trip from Florida to Michigan. In conclusion I highly recommend this car to anyone. I've owned this car for almost 3 years and I bought it used with only 5k miles on the odometer.,
2013,07-07-2016,3,0,5, Great and fun car to drive!  I would recommend this to any two-party couples to drive for fun!,
2013,04-07-2017,3,0.8954,5,Our previous jetta topped out at about 25 mpg but was also a great car.,
2013,01-10-2016,4,0,5, This has been a great car. I am 45 years old this week only owned 4 cars prior 1 Nissan and 3 Volvos. VW Jetta has been great no issues at all. Very affordable(Volvo out-priced me and stopped selling 4 series). So good that husband bought a 2015 Passat. Husband owned about 1cars since we married 24 years ago. Passat not as good as Jetta sorry to say. Never had any maintenance issues with Jetta. Only issues are it is sometimes hard to get key out of ignition and sometimes difficult to see out of rear window. Gas mileage exceeds what is printed on invoice.,
2014,09-02-2016,1,0.7351,5,I bought it on the spot. I've only had it a month but I can't say anything negative about it. It's a kick to drive.,
2014,28-03-2016,1,0,5,I test drove the TDI as was totally impressed with the ride. This car is tight. My biggest concern was how the TDI would handle acceleration onto the interstate and passing at high speed.... Wow! This car can keep up with anything.,
2014,20-03-2017,1,0.8309,3," Terrific to drive a true driver's car. I'm 6'4"" and I fit in nicely. Excellent gas mileage 30mpg on daily driving! Premium gas only.... The fit and finish is EL CHEAPO. Flimsy upholstery and lots of hard plastic. Rear seats are ""pretend"" it should be classified as a 2+2...Interior components fail having seat railings and the seatbelt changed under warranty. Also several issues with engine oil leaks were fixed under warranty and I am a rather gentle driver so reliability is not all that good at all. It looks beautiful it's designed to accommodate all drivers even very tall ones. It's great on gas and with the GTI engine it's a BLAST!",
2014,22-08-2014,3,-0.6249,4.5, I was looking for a 2 door hatchback on Edmonds.com and frankly didn't know the Beetle was a hatchback. After reading the general reviews I concentrated on the TDI rather than the gas 2.0 Turbo as it requires premium gas. (I have a fairly long commute),
2014,20-07-2016,3,0.8169,4,The fit and finish is excellent and you can't beat the styling.,
2014,26-10-2015,4,0.612,5,Love the styling and ride. Can't beat the mpg.,
2015,20-02-2015,1,-0.0831,5,Mechanically the car is a dream.  Strong excelleration breaking and handling.  The transmission is a lot of fun.  Using either the paddle shifters or the the sport shifter the response is instant.,
2015,12-01-2016,1,0.5908,5,We got the TSI instead of diesel (the purchase was before the emissions scandal) because we found it was snappier. We test drove A LOT of vehicles and are still puzzled by a) how under the radar it is in the US market and b) how reasonable the price is for the quality of drive and interior. Definitely check it out.,
2015,14-02-2016,1,0.8765,5,The side mirrors could include the corner oval that would help see cars right next to you in the blind spot but most cars will probably have electronic warning indicators in the near future.  The trans goes to neutral when you come to a stop so you CANNOT put your left foot on the brake and your right on the accelerator to pull into another lane in heavy traffic.  (As soon as you take your foot off the brake nothing is happening). It's a trade off for better fuel economy-less resistance on the engine when stopped. Occasionally the computer controlling the radio/nav has problems on start-up.  I've had occasions where the radio is on but no sound will come out.  ,
2015,16-03-2016,1,0,4,The Fender stereo setup is decent for the price range.  ,
2015,06-06-2015,2,0.8225,5,My only complaint is the slow system bootup of the electronics my wife's Nissan comes online instantly while the Passat takes as much as a full minute.  I'm hoping the upgrade in the 2016 resolves the glitch.,
2015,18-06-2015,2,0.7469,4.5, The Volkswagen TDI SEL 2.0 is a very good highway car in the $30k range with a strong turbo assisted diesel and great milage.   In eight months I am approaching 18k miles and am averaging 42 mpg which includes a good mix of bumper to bumper stop and go Tollway driving as well as open highway cruising. As pro reviewers stated it's solid  and very roomy.  The radio display is a bit boring with a basic red on black display and the response time is slow from pressing the touch screen to seeing anything happen. ( The screen is not an iPad),
2015,30-06-2015,2,0.9862,4.875,"One nice thing about this car is that my 6'1"" husband can sit in the backseat without his head touching the ceiling. Though he's not crazy tall we've still found that to be rare. ",
2015,27-04-2016,2,0,4,Trunk space is very decent and roomy. Back seat is very spacious.  Seats are comfortable and the combo leather and cloth is a good touch.  The cloth doesn't freeze in the winter or burn you in the summer. The sun roof opening is Ok and the wind screen is a nice touch.  ,
2015,26-05-2016,2,0.9183,4,,
2015,25-07-2015,3,0.9592,5,There are four things I've asked myself about this car but I still give it a 5-star rating and two thumbs up. First why no USB port?... just weird.  I mean they don't even have an iPhone 5 adapter.  If no USB port then they should send an inventory of adapters to dealers to outfit each car. Second why no heated seats on the S trim when even the base Jetta with cloth has them?  I live in Colorado and use the heated seats from time to time.  Now I'll have to pay $450 for a local shop to install them (with most of the cost in labor).  Third (and this applies to all Golfs in general) why not just put a soft plastic upper panel on the back seat passenger doors and match up the quality of everywhere else in the car?  My prior JSW had that.  Lastly I've heard the reasons why they dropped the IRS from the GSW and Golf TDI to accommodate emissions and I find it tuned okay but it just bothers me when I think about it.,
2015,31-07-2015,3,0.971,5, This car is miles ahead of the previous Jetta wagon. I opted for the optional lighting package really gives the car a high end feel.,
2015,31-07-2015,3,0,5, Seeing only two consumer reviews on Edmunds at this point is kind of disappointing for how great this car really is.  I have the S trim so now there's an SEL and SE and an S review. I wasn't willing to buy up to the SE trim at this time but I find a lot of value in the car even at the S level.  I had bought the 2015 Golf TSI SE as well earlier in the year but kept finding that with 3 kids and a dog and road travel the extra space was needed.  However in owning the SE things like the sunroof Fender audio heated seats RSWs etc. were all nice but I really liked how solid and quiet the Golf was to drive.  It made driving easy and that's what opened me up to try the S trim.  It's a real shame this is a niche car all because of the influence of the truck/SUV on American mind sets.,
2015,14-08-2015,3,0.9296,5, I've been driving gas and diesel VWs for 35 years with my previous ride being a 312k mile 2002 Jetta TDI that's never had a major problem and still runs great but time to move on.  I considered a Passat but bigger than I needed and drove like a large car meh styling.  I'd considered the now discontinued Jetta Sportwagen but it had the lesser version of the TDI blob styling and just couldn't get excited.  This new Golf Sportwagen snuck up on me going from being unaware of it to in my garage in about two weeks.,
2015,24-08-2015,3,0.3016,5, ,
2015,08-09-2015,3,0,3,Even though the Golf has historically been positioned as their low end model series in recent years it has enjoyed a rep as their performance series with classic VW Euro handling more sporty everything and even higher end interiors.  ,
2015,18-09-2015,3,0.933,5,Favorite feature? It checks all the boxes!  - Room like an SUV - Drives like a FUN car - Can haul everything you own  - Gets Prius MPG (45 highway) with diesel - Feels luxurious inside: not like a Toyota/Subaru you got loaded but more like an Audi/BMW if that makes sense - More fun than any sub $50K SUV out there - The pleather/leatherette is actually really nice - I can't think of what this car is missing there is detail in everything they did here - I dare someone to find such a nice balance of a car elsewhere ,
2015,07-07-2016,3,0.7003,5, Best car I've ever owned! The utility of an suv the economy of a compact all in a fun to drive package! And only about $20.000 great value!!!!,
2015,07-07-2016,3,0.296,5,"I really wanted a snappy handling car like my old Jetta and previous GTI so as stated above the Golf series is the closest you can get in their line-up.  This thing handles much better than a Passat if not quite my older VWs.  The S version has only 16"" wheels but my experience is that is good enough with good rubber.   ",
2015,13-07-2016,3,0.3612,5, I love my Passat.  The quality is far better than what is being offered by competitors.  The drive is amazing.  This is my 3rd Diesel VW product.  I drive over 30K miles a year and have never had more than routine maintenance performed.  NEVER one quality issue in over 300K miles driven.  And the service is great.  Free loaners they wash your car and the intervals are 10K miles not 5 or less like most cars.  By far the most economical car to own compared to the competition.  My wife was a Honda girl but she is a convert and also has a VW now.  You cannot go wrong with a VW diesel.  ,
2015,18-08-2016,3,0.9496,5," I bought my Sportwagen diesel 3 weeks before they announced the diesel scam. I got an incredible deal on both my trade in and the new car. I soon found out why. But! This is a great car. Lots of room for kids and dogs. It handles beautifully on the road. Turning is very smooth unlike anything I've ever felt. Mileage on diesel fuel is outstanding. I average 40 mpg in the city. On the highway however I get about 50 mpg.  My fuel costs have dropped dramatically. I have and paid for ""pulse"" on the third brake which routinely shows up as broken on my info screen now I just ignore it. I love this car it's easy to get in and out of and completely fills my need for a vehicle. I have tossed around the idea of the buyback but I love this car so much I can't find anything else I want. I consider myself very luck to have the diesel. Winter in Wisconsin has proven to be no issue for the Diesel engine with the right fuel.  So I'm 100% happy with this little wagon!",
2015,25-09-2016,3,-0.4023,5,Also expensive for a car in this segment.,
2015,14-10-2015,4,0.25,5, Bought a new fully loaded diesel sportwagen. First and foremost: This car is MUCH faster than its HP suggests. The diesel pulls effortlessly and is very quiet. The gas engine is good but this engine is something I've never experienced before and I come from a 2015 GTI (this is our second VW). The panoramic sunroof makes it feel like your car is almost a convertible. Diesel is so fuel-efficient it is crazy. I was afraid of the UREA scrub but its like adding windshield washer fluid - so simple. The reason I was so drawn to VW in the first place - it feels MUCH more expensive than its price tag suggests and has a soul to it. Its not boring like the cute 'ute competition.,
2015,15-10-2015,4,0,5, We were looking at crossovers since we've recently started a family but they were all so meh in test drives. We ended up test driving this one because it was at the lot next door and we feel just incredibly lucky that we did. We LOVE it. It's zippy and fun with a crazy amount of cargo space (comparable or greater than most crossovers) and is very quiet and smooth to drive. We got the base model because it's already well equipped and the quality of the interior for the price is just incredible. I discovered that we actually like to have a car with subtle elegant styling instead a tank that looks like it's ready to go mud slinging. ,
2015,31-10-2015,4,0.886,5, Quick enough solid feeling high end interior and fuel mileage that rocks! Fun to drive beautiful to look at. Mine had 40 miles on the odometer when I bought it and a few scratches on the interior but I saved 3500 off MSRP. VERY happy after 2800 miles.,
2015,31-10-2015,4,0.6249,4, Let me start by saying I traded in my midlife crisis Mustang for this car.  I am not disappointed in my decision.  I needed a sedan that would allow me to shuttle customers/coworkers/suppliers.  The backseat is the largest in its class the trunk holds plenty of luggage and the style is subtle but refined.,
2015,23-11-2015,4,0.6369,4," Beetle R-line front seats are not comfortable for those of us with ""larger bottoms"" and legs.  ",
2015,06-10-2016,4,0.3182,5,Update: After another 10000 miles I still enjoy the car.  I admit I have shopped a bit recently but cannot find another vehicle that goes toe to toe with the V6 Passat in this price range.  The closest thing I have found are a Mercedes E350 and a Lexus GS350 both of which are too much money for moving up a single Peggy on the board.,
2016,20-01-2016,1,0.6249,5, Considering the options available for this car this is definitely the best bang for the buck out there.  Especially when considering the other vehicles out there that offer dynamic suspension automatic w/ paddle shifters and a 0-60 in under 5 secs (they just don't exist in the Golf R's price range).  ,
2016,24-01-2016,1,0.0516,5,All in all a versatile safe nimble car for young families that is a blast to drive. If you are shopping for a mid range car (the usual Fords Hondas Toyotas or Subarus) this is a must test drive car. Better yet test drive this right after your top choice from other brands before you decide. You don't have to drive a crossover for added cargo space and worry about rollover later.,
2016,27-01-2016,1,0.9698,3, It felt (and sounded) like we were riding on a corrugated surface - very disappointing!,
2016,06-02-2016,1,0.962,5, Handles great. Awesome acceleration. Great electronics. A super fun car. You can tell that you're in a Golf because some items are obviously spec'd for a lower price point. However this much fun in a practical car cannot be passed up and the lower price point for a VW is still on par with a similarly priced BMW. Only an Audi/Mercedes will get you truly better interior.,
2016,07-02-2016,1,-0.3651,4,One of the things I have come to like a lot about the Golf R is that it is a wolf in sheep's clothing.  It doesn't beg for attention from law enforcement like other performance cars do.  Yet it has plenty of thrill providing capabilities whenever the mood strikes.  And it's practical enough for grocery shopping and driving my kids.,
2016,08-02-2016,1,0.9763,5,Couple of cons to keep in mind - noticeable Turbo lag at the start from 6 speed transmission but brilliant at highway speeds pretty much point and shoot at 4 5 and 6th speeds. No power seats for SE. Come on VW that is lame.,
2016,07-04-2016,2,0.8591,5,The Golf R is a total blast to drive.  It hangs in the curves like it's on rails.  Mine has the DCC suspension.  The best part is that the 'comfort' setting dials everything back enough that my mother would have no problems driving it.  Most of the time I leave the suspension dialed in to the 'race' setting which is fine for most of my driving.  ,
2016,03-05-2016,2,0.9913,4,We've now been driving the new TSI Sportwagen for six months and remain very pleased. It is very comfortable and quiet for long trips and equally adept and nimble in urban driving. The cargo space is cavernous and significantly larger than most comparable small SUV's I've found I can actually carry more than several friends who own larger crossover vehicles. We have also found the driver assist features - something we felt we had no need for - and excellent bonus. VW's adaptive cruise control blind spot sensors and rear collision avoidance and back up camera are all excellent features and perform very well. Our only complaint is that the blind spot warning lights on the side mirrors are quite small and the same orange color as the turn signal indicators making them less visible than they should be.,
2016,06-05-2016,2,-0.9056,5, Love this car. FWIW I'm a 52 year old owner. I love Hondas for their reliability. I got 275000 on my cr-v but was taken by the Volvo wagon at the auto show this year. However after reading several reviews and seeing a 10000 price difference between the se golf version and the Volvo I opted for the VW. To keep it short all I can say is it's awesome. Ride handling electronics is awesome. The only downside I see is getting in and out of the vehicle. Mind you I'm over 50 so a lower seat height is difficult compared to sliding your butt in on an SUV. Other than that  I get 10mpg more than my former vehicle fun driving and a quiet ride. Very satisfied.,
2016,06-05-2016,2,0.5719,5," Granted options are limited for the wagon enthusiasts out there but I'm really loving this car.  A lot.  I of course did my homework and drove several cars (Civic Accord Mazda 3 and others) before driving the Sportwagen.  Like the reviews elsewhere have noted it's a drivers car; crisp handling reasonable acceleration solid as a rock and very quiet on the inside.  That this combination of subtly surprising performance is cloaked in a wagon's exterior makes it all the more awesome.  It does seem to search for the right gear at low speeds (<15 mph) but it find it's groove quickly thereafter.  The 1.8 turbo is nicely suited to the car and it never feels under-powered.  The seats are also very comfortable front and back.  The resolution of the 5"" audio display/back-up camera is a little low but it's about the only gripe I have about the car.",
2016,03-06-2016,2,0.6124,5,Overall there is very little that I would have changed about this car.  My 1st complaint is the lack of a sun roof on the R model.  On the flip side a sunroof decreases chassis stiffness and moves the center of gravity higher both of which adversely affect handling.  Supposedly the Euro spec model comes with a sunroof.  I could have sacrificed a little in the handling dept. for a sunroof.,
2016,11-06-2016,2,0.9468,5, I needed a small low wagon so that my two aging golden retrievers could jump in the car easily but still have room. Edmonds price quote was lower than anyone else's and the dealership in st Augustine fl honored it! We are very happy with Edmonds the dealership and the car!,
2016,18-06-2016,2,0.9542,5, We use it for a promotional car for our local business and people love it.,
2016,25-06-2016,2,0,5, I have owned it for a month with only 1500 miles and I must say I love this car. I love the DCC and the ability on how it controls the suspension. I honestly thought it was going to a small improvement but comfort really sorts out the bumpy roads quite well. Race mode makes things fun and tight. You can also custom Taylor the individual mode to how you like it too. Driving this car is very fun and I never want to get out of it. I also have a new BMW 328xi which use to be fun but now drives like a boat compared to the R. If you have the chance to buy one just get it. It's a fast fun rocket that sits 4 comfortable with a very nice refined interior. The DSG transmission shifts awesome and keeps the revs up high while in sport mode. I initially tested out a bunch of performance cars at first but once I drove the R it was a solid choice that ticked all the boxes perfect. All this package for under 40k was a great choice.,
2016,02-07-2016,3,0.9796,5,We also have a Subaru Forester and we find ourselves driving the Sportwagen whenever we can even on longer trips as it's a much more comfortable (and fun) ride.  We find that the cargo area actually holds more of our stuff than does the Subie.  The cargo area is deeper (though not taller) than the Forester and 4 of our travel suitcases fit perfectly in the back.  ,
2016,01-08-2016,3,0.8638,5, This is definitely one of the most stunning and surprising cars that I've ever driven that has a high-quality Porsche feel to it when you're driving. I also love the fact that it is purely a sleeper car. For a mere $800 you can get a stage 1 tune and add almost an extra 100 HP and beat 2015 M3s Porsche Carreras and all sorts of muscle cars from Mustangs to Camaros and Dodge Chargers/Challengers. What's even more amusing is when you add some turns to the track and the Golf R will compete extremely well against anything you throw at it. Even with all the power the gas mileage is pretty high around 25/26 combined mpg (80% city 20% hwy).,
2016,15-08-2016,3,0.9403,5, As owners of a much beloved 2012 Jetta Sportwagen TDI we thought long and hard about purchasing another VW. After evaluating many options we decided on a new 2016 Golf Sportwagen TSI as our second vehicle and as an eventual replacement of the TDI which was due to be returned. So we were in the unusual position of driving the TDI and this new TSI Sportwagens at the same time in a real apples-to-apples comparison. We LOVED our TDI but this new Golf Sportwagen simply slays it. A more responsive engine superior transmission smoother and quieter ride more controlled handling and braking (didn't think we could get better than the TDI) better interior and exterior fit and finish and a slightly higher seat position and more interior and storage space have already convinced us we made the right decision. I'm back to driving the TDI the past week as my wife is driving the new car and it feels like a tank in comparison. It didn't hurt that we got an incredible deal on a 2016 year-end close-out. On the con side the TSI has significantly less torque than the TDI but we're surprised that the TSI actually has better acceleration. ,
2016,22-08-2016,3,0.9555,4," Love the car but not the gas mileage. Had a diesel so probably not fare to compare. Been told have to ""break it in some more"" before I can get better mileage. The USB port is in a tight space in the small storage space. Overall I do like the car a lot",
2016,05-09-2016,3,0.9881,5, Bargain for the roof rack.  What a ripoff at more than $300 extra.  Should be standard.  Good car overall comfortable maneuverable good mileage.  Love the huge roof rack,
2016,27-09-2016,3,0.9989,5, Really happy with my 2016 GolfSportWagen LE.  First and foremost this is a driver's car (it is a Golf after all) -- it is responsive with the turbo kick at low RPM's it has great handling and a sporty (but still comfortable) ride it brakes very well and it really likes windy roads.  Second it has the versatility and functionality for a growing family -- tons of room in the cargo area with easy fold-down rear seats for putting a bike in.  Third it has great features -- panoramic sunroof CarPlay advanced safety features automatic cruise control etc.  It is well designed and has high end touches everywhere.  With all of this the car was a really good value.  The only cons I have found so far are: (A) small fuel tank -- ~13 gallons so the decent fuel economy is offset by having to refuel more often; (B) sometimes rough downshifts when coasting which lead to more engine braking than desired.,
2016,21-12-2015,4,0.8419,5, Great car ! Writing review after owning it for a month. Bought in SF Bay Area. Superb ride quality excellent visibility and top notch fit and finish. Plenty of cargo space. Definite looker like its cousin Audi A4 wagon. Drives as a German car for sure responsive very easy to drive and rock solid feel. Not yet rated for 2016 but based on 2015 Golf safety ratings from last year most likely a top IIHS safety pick and 5 star NHTSA safety rating since no change to body structure. ,
2016,27-12-2015,4,0.9781,5, High performance meets practicality.  It's awesome.  Does everything as advertised.,
2016,01-10-2016,4,0.8658,4, Standout from the crowd.   This car is great value for money. Even base model is well equipped. I got an excellent discount during model year end sale  through Edmunds pricing option. Drives and handles like it's on rails and soaks up bumps easily. Excellent visibility all around. Trunk has tons of space and beats cargo room of any SUV. However back seat height and legroom could be improved. I also wish the seat bottoms provided a little more thigh support.  No automatic trunk release from inside the car.,
2016,03-10-2016,4,0.3752,3, I'm a big fan of blind spot monitors especially since they help in merging and shifting lanes on a busy freeway. I have these monitors on my Toyota Avalon and my Mazda 3 and these monitors work seamlessly. However the blind spot monitor on the VW golf is not only useless it is unsafe.  First of all the monitors are difficult to see partly because they're tiny and partly because the lights are not bright enough. Driving in bright sunlight makes it really difficult to see these lights. Secondly some genius in VW thought it would be a really smart idea to place blinking turn signal lights one inch from the blind spot monitors. As a result when I turn on my turn signal in preparation for a lane shift what I see in my side mirror are bright blinking lights not the blind spot monitor.  Seeing blinking lights makes one hesitate momentarily and that hesitation can spell the difference between a smooth lane change and an unsafe one. I've now deactivated the blind spot monitors on the VW Golf sportwagen  and instead angle my mirrors outwards to cover my blind spots. Since this is a safety issue I believe VW should address these problem. Right now I would settle for larger side mirrors without blind spot monitors.   I also find that the rear cross traffic alert is unreliable occasionally failing to detect vehicles moving behind me. For a driver to trust a cross traffic alert system the system has to work every single time. I've also deactivated adaptive cruise control because it makes the car decelerate suddenly when the vehicle in front makes a turn. This happens even when there is ample space between vehicles and slowing down is not necessary. I chose to spend the extra cash for these safety features because I was buying this car for my daughter but now I feel I just wasted my money on these features.,
2016,08-10-2016,4,0.9966,5, Two cars were in my final list; the R and a Focus RS. Here in Canada (Nova Scotia...had to use a Maine zip code to submit my review) the RS is $8k (!) more than the R. So the R was the obvious selection...and I am not disappointed. Definitely understated WRT its exterior...and I'm fine with that. Folks who know cars come up an ask me about routinely. It is very quick...especially when moving from 2nd 3rd thru 4th. Brakes are outstanding. Got a chance to enjoy the 4Motion in the snow the day it arrived (March 2016) and through out the remainder of the winter...also excellent on dry pavement when you are working the corners hard. Interior is consistent with VW/Audi...logical and good quality. Lots of soft surfaces. The exhaust tone is a bit pedestrian but not a big issue for me. One item of ongoing irritation - Android Auto. Quite unreliable - only connects to my phone after multiple efforts. Once it does it's great (Spotify Google Maps) but it should be seamless. Summary for someone living in Canada there aren't may vehicles that can touch the R's performance/$ ratio.,
2016,10-10-2016,4,0.7174,5,Engine is alright but the transmission is completely out of its element at speeds between 20 and 60 mph. If you keep it in drive it will have you lugging the engine up a hill in 6th gear at 30 mph.,
2016,19-10-2016,4,0.128,5,On a positive note the ride is excellent (when the car isn't vibrating) the interior is great and the seats are comfortable.,
2016,20-10-2016,4,0.8915,5, It's perfect for someone wanting a small commuter car with lots of room when needed. Cargo space is great. The ride is comfortable. The car drives well and the tornado red is the perfect color. I love it!,
2016,22-10-2016,4,0.9775,2, Great car if you're not worried about quality and reliability issues. I had to bring the car to the dealer for three separate repairs before I hit 10000 miles. Twice for a leaking sunroof and I've also had issues with vibration at highway speeds window squeaks and peeling paint on the rear bumper.,
2016,22-10-2016,4,0.8516,5, My VW Beetle Convertible is perfect in the city for urban driving while also being remarkably comfortable and well suited to the highway for long trips.  It has just enough features to make it feel modern without going overboard and having too much gimmickry and engineering.  The styling is excellent interior room is abundant (even for tall drivers like me) and performance is peppy and smooth as silk.  I regard this car as underrated and under-appreciated by the reviewers.  Anyone who drives it for even one day will be grinning from ear to ear.,
2016,27-10-2016,4,0.5267,4,MPG isn't quite as good as advertised.  And will get slightly worse if you add the APR stage 1 kit (even though APR claims otherwise) - my combined MPG is around 22.  However gas milage is still darn respectable considering the performance.  Adding the stage 1 APR kit drops the 0-60 time to under 4 secs.  And keeping the foot off the gas pedal becomes an exercise in will power.,
2016,17-11-2016,4,-0.8338,4, Got this after my lease on Sportwagen TDI expired. Two major gripes about the car -  automatic transmission is jerky when car slows down to about 30-20mph and right before stopping. As if it doesn't know what to do downshifting gears abruptly. Unpleasant. Second - after about 5 months of driving it noticed a sizable stain on the roof (moonroof) liner right where it meets rear tailgate. It has overtime became slightly less than a foot long and is as wide as the whole roof. Car is being taken care of right now by the dealer who is doing great job keeping me updated on the progress. But it seems like serious manufacturing defect due to improper welding  around moonroof. A smaller thing but also annoying. When accelerating if I press the pedal quickly nothing happens at all for the first half a second or so then it suddenly jumps. There is a certain amount of lag and it seems to become more and more noticeable as I drive the car more. Everything else about the car is fantastic I was able to hit 40 mpg on my way to work during 22 mile drive many times. Usually if driven carefully the car achieves 35mpg no problem. Very spacious and sporty at the same time. Interior quality is so much better than many Japanese cars and design is more subtle minimalistic just right for me.,
2017,01-01-2017,1,0.9685,5, Not quite as nice as my 2009 TDI but very good for the money.  Fun to drive.  Great features.  Manual is very nice.   Mileage is exceptional for non-Diesel.,
2017,01-01-2017,1,0.9784,5,Update: One thing I have noticed in the almost 10k miles of owning the vehicles is that the paint is far too delicate. The piano black decorative trim on the door B-pillars is liquid and even fingers leave marks that require abrasives to remove. If you are very picky about your vehicle upkeep and like it perfect like me be prepared to work hard for it!,
2017,01-01-2017,1,0.9873,5, Great road handling.  Outstanding in snow/ice.  I love the iPhone display on the car's display (car play).  Not great acceleration but I didn't expect or need that.  Shifting gears is a little sluggish and there's a barely audible transmission noise shifting in the lower gears.  I'm getting a little better mileage than I expected (22-25 around town) and 33-34 highway.  Still early but I love the car so far.,
2017,03-01-2017,1,0.9966,5, The Sport trim offers you the best value in your GTI I feel. It is almost like the Autobahn compared to the SE just spend the $1500 or so more you won't regret it. I got a great deal on my GTI Sport. I will get the negatives out of the way now since the list is still really short after 1 month of ownership. There are no fog lamps on this trim level. This was quite troublsome the other night in a white-out snow. THe road holding wasn't the issue visibility was and fog lamps would've been really nice to have. You get the lighting package however which gives you the lovely and aggressive looking xenon headlights and LED DRL lights. Ties the front together nicely every GTI should have these. The adaptive lighting when turning at slower speeds is also much better than in was on my 2012 Golf TDI. Quicker to respond quicker to turn off and better at throwing the light. Second negative rides a bit harsh I feel for normal driving the last generation of GTI was a bit more comfy in a straight line or during casual driving however it also didn't turn like the Mk7. This car's new MQB platform from Audi is a MAJOR improvement in the Golf/GTI lineup and handling is bliss in a corner when you throw it around a bit. Sharp direct and almost like an extension of your arms when you hold at 3 & 9'o clocks. Also you could teach someone with getting comfortable with a manual transmission or at least the principles of it. Super easy clutch almost too easy I plan to do some aftermarket work in there anyways but for the masses it is decent. I have had one defect so far a piece of cloth that forms the backing of the rear armrest fell off and the armrest is back-ordered minor detail. Can't even see it unless you look in from the rear. I am not concerned with it right now. The positives go on and on and on. But I will let you find out for yourself! ,
2017,04-01-2017,1,0,5, The car is only a month old for me but I absolutely love driving it.  I commute 100 miles a day and this car makes it much less of a chore.  Acceleration on the highway is amazing and the nimble handling makes it a blast to drive around town.  The only knock that I would give it is that I am struggling to get close to the advertised MPG.  That might be attributed to a heavy foot though.  :-),
2017,05-01-2017,1,0.5994,5,The SE package is the only trim offering this year but valued well with every 2016 SEL amenity sans some front lighting features. ,
2017,14-01-2017,1,0.9691,2, I'm a former Passat TDi owner and sold my Passat back to VW. I decided to be a loyal customer and bought a new 2017 Passat. I'm so disappointed in my purchase because I told myself to buy the Accord especially after dealing with the TDI issue. I went ahead anyway and purchased a new Passat SE with technology package. Don't Do It!!!! The front seat hurts my back as I commute daily for work about 60 miles a day. The pickup and transmission lag stinks. Oh My Sunroof switch Just broke after owning the car for a little over a month. I wish I could return the car and buy a Honda Accord.,
2017,14-01-2017,1,-0.5095,5, I owned 3 Tribeca Subaru and 1 Audi Q5; they were too small.  The Touareg is just right; it doesn't bump my head on the lift gate. There is just my wife and me and for us it is a perfect fit.  I was surprised at the good acceleration and disappointed with the low end torque since my two other Touaregs were the 3.0 diesels.  I think the air resources agencies have an aim to get rid of diesels.,
2017,19-01-2017,1,0.7717,5, So happy with my purchase only thing wrong with it is that I didn't make it sooner.,
2017,21-01-2017,1,-0.3149,5, I was one of the early buyers of this model ordered it from the factory fully loaded and took delivery in October. I'm a guy who loves to drive and having owned many other European models including Audi Porsche Land Rover Volvo and Mercedes I find VW the right mix of quality attention to detail simplicity technology and driving enjoyment. VW bought out my Jetta Sportwagen TDI regrettably giving that up as I'm a fan of diesels but a bigger fan of the environment. I considered many other models including hybrids however having owned Asian hybrids in the past including Honda Toyota and Subaru I find the cars absolutely boring to drive after a few months. Yes I strongly considered the Subaru Outback as an alternative but find the current generation model bloated-looking and do not like the Lineartronic CVT transmission. My Alltrack is fully loaded and I enjoy the styling and especially the lighting option that sets the car apart.  Acceleration transmission and road-feel are all very good definitely a step-up from the Jetta Sportwagen TDI. I do primarily city driving and I'm averaging 21 mpg (my diesel averaged 25 mpg city driving). On the highway I've averaged 33 mpg. I did have issues with the compass which impacted the NAV (factory re-call) and the lane assist program functions both repaired under warranty. I love wagons but here in the US options are limited to Subaru Audi Mercedes BMW and Volvo the 4 latter models being significantly higher priced. As far as I'm concerned the VW Golf Alltrack SEL with the driver assistance and lighting option package is a very similar wagon to the Audi Allroad makes sense since they share many of the same parts. Also the Audi Allroad runs on premium while the VW Alltrack runs on regular gas. To sum I really love this wagon and just waiting for some Chicago snow to test the 4-Motion AWD!,
2017,22-01-2017,1,0.5984,5,Two wishes: tighter steering although there is much to be said for the nimble nature of the current set-up.               Also versus my 2012 Jetta TDI I have lost around 29 lb-ft torque.                                         Enter the GLI horse power enter my grin and the clamouring for the lost torque is a long distant memory (sort of like the car that could have been behind me just a second ago). ,
2017,23-01-2017,1,0.8588,5," My Autobahn: leather/heat/power seat DCC Nav and ACC/Blind Spot/Cross Traffic safety features. Got an amazing year-end deal that I could not pass so I will return my VW TDI earlier than plan.  1k miles total so far in 2 weeks.  During past GTI test drives I always thought the ride was a bit stiff so I decided to get the Autobahn with DCC.  That way I can turn the suspension to a softer mode (""comfort"") when needed.   Funny after 2 weeks I now prefer ""sport"" mode over regular ""normal"" or ""comfort"" mode.  The GTI MK7 engine is very smooth as it happily rev up to its red line.  Combined with its lightweight the GTI can quickly and easily pass other cars at highway speed.   You can get speeding ticket(s) if you are not careful with this car as it goes from 60 to 80 mph in no time.  It makes me wonder what APR stage 1 or 2 mod will turn this car into ?  As a manual trans driver in the past I found the DSG pretty amazing on any street at any speed.  I don't understand all of GTI DSG complaints out there.  Nobody can shift the transmission as fast and smooth aggressive when needed than this smartly engineered DSG.  The DSG in my 2013 TDI is good this one is GREAT.  As advertised GTI returns 29 mpg combined.  I am very happy with its safety features they are excellent and work as designed.   The bad news ?  quality control is poor for a $36k list car.  Back window does not roll up/down driver door ambient light does not work back seat bench still have wrapping plastic protrude out from its bottom and worse the infotainment system with Nav broke (known issue) after three days - new unit is in ordered.  Even though CR predicts below reliability I'd expected better quality control after almost 2 year of Golf/GTI production in Mexico very disappointed.   My GTI issues are being fixed under warranty.  I gave VW GTI 5 stars mostly due to its interior luxury feel (very close to Audi BMW or Mercedes level) its Ultimate Driving Machine characteristics and its steep year-end discount.  Aside from the quality control annoyances  I have my grin every day driving this GTI.",
2017,25-01-2017,1,0,5, Great value awesome reliability,
2017,26-01-2017,1,0.7351,5," Budget vehicle to get from A to B. Cheap interior. I've leased it because this is my first VW. I've heard from friends that VW service is bad. When you lease a car most of the services shall be free. Not with VW. Dealer (Kings VW in Gaithersburg MD) tells me that NOT EVERYTHING IS COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY. And I get ""contact VW on the phone""  and "" we are not fixing this for free"". And I don't visit a dealer anymore. Not changing oil (dealr's fee is $86 + tax). Nope. I am going back to Toyota when your Toyota  dealer has free coffee juice and water while I am waiting and the oil changes are $19.99 + tax ( I miss those days). I've leased 3 Toyotas in the last 10 years. Toyota people are great. I have 9K miles to go and when I go I never buy or lease another VW.",
2017,30-01-2017,1,0.9485,5, My first Passat was a 2007 model which I loved and regret selling it. The 2017 R-Line model has made me forget about the previous models.  Great looking car and fun to drive so far. I work for Toyota but I choose the Passat over the Camry. I put over 40k on my previous models and had ZERO issues.,
2017,30-01-2017,1,0.5859,5, Needs a sliding armrest.,
2017,30-01-2017,1,0.4939,5, I love the practicality of a hatchback the large storage area nice seating for 5 (normal size people of course) great acceleration good fuel economy (could be a little better but not bad) solid breaking fun to drive great handling.,
2017,04-02-2017,1,0.891,5, Great car! I love my jetta! 1.4 turbo! 40 miles per gallon combine using gasoline 91 octane is awesome! Great Value for you money!,
2017,12-03-2017,1,0.5106,5, I thoroughly researched the midsize segment and found the Passat to be a perfect fit for me.  I live in metro Phoenix so opted for the S trim since I'm not a fan of leatherette seats in our intense summer heat.  The base model has plenty of standard features and I was able to purchase a new one for $18800.  I love the fit and finish of the vehicle with its accompanying handsome understated design and you'd be hard-pressed to find a comparable sedan for under 19K.  I've owned all type of cars from different manufacturers but this is my first VW and I am very pleased.  I highly recommend the Passat.,
2017,15-03-2017,1,0.5106,5, S trim lack lots of neat features which are available only in SE/SEL like climate control auto lights.,
2017,16-03-2017,1,0.9859,4, Quite a car for the money.  The 1.8T engine is peppy if not strong and smooth like a V6.  Two great fun options are the Tiptronic shifting and the Sport mode for the 6-speed transmission.  This car has a lot of technology and is fun to operate.  There is no native Navigation but there is interface to the iPhone and Android which is actually better than Navi because you are using your own phone which you know backwards and forwards.  All the features are projected to the large info screen on the dash.  This saves a good $1500-2000 from the MSRP.  First day I had 3 adult passengers for a trip to a baseball game with two six-footers in the back who raved about the roominess and the ride.  Gas mileage looks like as advertised.  Happy with this car.,
2017,19-03-2017,1,0.3064,5," After owning a 2006 Honda Accord V6 EXL with NAV for the past 5 years I was a little nervous about going with a VW with a 4 cylinder Engine; especially after having my mind set on getting a 14 Accord EXL V6. After about 4 months of research and 1 step in the Passat I knew this was the car for me. The VW Passat in my opinion is a totally different experience than what you expect with other brands. The VW Passat is classy solid and a true drivers car. The 1.8 tsi is peppy and an absolute blast to drive engine; I find myself having a lot more fun than I did driving with my V6. I even got 40 MPG on the freeway going 65 mph with the AC on. The controls are simple to use and everything feels like it's in the right place. The steering wheel is comfortable and doesn't take a long time getting used to. I opted for the lighting package which takes this car to an Audi level. I get lots of looks during the day thanks to the DRL LED strip. The 3 stage seat warmers are awesome and the seats are pretty comfortable. I am a tall guy and I absolutely love the room in this car I just turned 26 and wanted to get an ""adults"" car since I will be owning this car in my 30's. I feel very happy and confident in my decision to buy a new VW Passat. This car is surely to give me many years of reliability and fun. I know VW may have had some issues and people have a bad taste in thier mouth about VW but I have owned 3 Hondas and it wasn't always as reliable as the  perception would lead you to believe. I take great care of my cars and only use dealers. I put shell v power in my cars and do scheduled maintenance on time and still had issues with my accord's. I believe with maintaing my VW as I should it will prove to be just as dependable. If your considering Honda Toyota Nissan etc.. put the Passat SE with lighting on your list. One step in the VW will show you how a car should be built. Plus I got a $28010 dollar car for $22500!!! It was a no branienr.",
2017,22-03-2017,1,0.7351,5, Solid great car for the price,
2017,27-03-2017,1,0.9134,5, I rated acceleration 4 of 5 not cuz it's slow (it's actually really quick) but because there is a bit of turbo lag.  But once you get the swing of how to work with it with the manual trans it's not a problem.  This car is so solid confidence-inspiring and neutral feeling yet it feels ready to play at all times.  And it's an absolute monster on twisty roads.  All that and it's as sedate of a cruiser as you like when you want it to be.  Amazing all-arounder of a car.,
2017,06-04-2017,2,0.8682,4, A decent car except for the Japanese automatic transmission. I owned a 2009 and 2015 Jetta TDI with the DSG transmission and am extremely disappointed with the transmission in the 2017 Passat SE.  The upshift from 3 to 4 and the downshift from 5 to 4 are jerky and noisy unlike the DSG transmission of my two previous Jettas. The jerk and noise is especially noticeable when driving normally at the speed limits in small towns but not noticeable when accelerating more aggressively with the gas peddle when getting up to highway speed.  I would not buy this car if you love the smoothness of the DSG transmission in prior VW models.  None of the Passat SE models had DSG when I was buying and I did not notice the difference when test driving so I bought the car assuming that the 6-speed automatic Japanese transmission would be OK.  I was wrong.  The other minor annoyance is this car does not have park assist (which I don't care about) but I frequently get a notification on the screen that there is no park assist.  Why would I want to know this when I don't have it?  I will be trading in this car when VW decides to add DSG to the Passat SE line.  The only model that has DSG at this time is the gas guzzling Passat SEL and the tradeoff isn't worth paying royalties to oil companies that have inflated prices at a time of historically low demand for fuel.,
2017,10-04-2017,2,0.9484,4, Best electronics (CarPlay) interior fit and finish in the segment.,
2017,17-04-2017,2,0.8397,1, Strong running  1.4 liter tubo charged engineTiptronic automatic transmission is a perfect for Jetta TSi .,
2017,26-04-2017,2,0,5, Quality built car. The engine is a MONSTER !!!!! I was looking at mini Cooper and test drove the gti and was sold. The space and fuel economy and powerful sports car is a no brainier.  The quality that went into this car is ridiculous from the steering wheel to the interior doors.,
2017,07-05-2017,2,0.961,4, I've been driving an autobahn trim for the past four months. Overall I think this is a very good car for daily driving but it's far from perfect. The DCC in comfort mode does improve the ride quality significantly giving a firm but smooth ride around town. However the ride deteriorates at high speeds (70 to 75 mph) and becomes somewhat rough and bouncy. It wouldn't be my first choice if I was going on a long road trip. I think the blind spot monitor system is unsafe. The warning light comes on late and I can often see a vehicle in my blind spot before the light turns on. I do think the adaptive cruise control is useful and easy to operate. For everyday music listening the Fender system does not offer much more than the lower level 8 speaker system. For comparison my daughter drives a golf sportwagen with a base sound system and I think it sounds just as good. For what it's worth my recommendation to VW is to offer both 17 inch and 18 inch wheels so drivers who want a more compliant ride can choose the smaller wheels. Also VW needs to work on their  blind spot detection system.,
2017,13-05-2017,2,0,5, VW got it right here. Amazing value.,
2017,20-05-2017,2,0.8922,5, Few of the other drivers on the road know what you have until you hit the gas. You'll get knowing looks from GTIs. A $50k car for half the price.,
2017,22-05-2017,2,-0.9221,5," Turned in my 2013 diesel TDI SE pursuant to the emissions fraud settlement and bought a gas powered 2017 SE 4cyl. with the proceeds.  Sweet riding and driving car. Well put together. If you liked the 2012-2016 Passat you will feel at home with the 2017 model. Not many changes. The gas powered Passat doesn't have the torqued up feel of the diesel version. The engine and transmission don't break speed down hill like the diesel version did. Consequently I anticipate that it will burn brakes faster than the earlier diesel versions. The standard 4cyl. 1.8 turbo powered engine has plenty of get up and go. However fuel economy is nowhere close to the earlier diesel versions. Unlike the diesel versions that got great mileage all the time mileage on the gas powered 2017 Passat tends to run in two modes: low to mid 20s in town and mid to high 30s on the interstate. Not much in between. However I think 40 mpg is possible on a long trip if the gasoline powered car is driven properly. My diesel TDI routinely got over 50 mpg on long trips.  VW decided to reduce the vertical opening of the front door entry way by about 1"". That was a terrible mistake. It may make the car look sportier but it makes it more difficult to get in and out of if you are 6'2"" tall or more. People don't buy a Passat to be sporty. No free maintenance program comes with this car.  It has a large back-up camera and blind spot warning sensors etc.. Stereo system Bluetooth and other electronic app functions work great. Same huge trunk. Heated front seats. AC system and controls have been enhanced.  LED lighting package is a worthwhile option. I am basically delighted with my 2017 Passat SE.  I hope it will prove to be a versatile and maintenance free car over time.",
2017,26-05-2017,2,0.9299,5, This is a fun car to drive. I purchase the SE with technology and this car is great. I disagree with Edmunds about the sluggish transmission NOT. Feels like a sport car and it competes with its rivals. It is loaded with technology and worth the price I paid $ 22671 after taxes ETC and trade in. Such a steal on the MSRP is $ 29375,
2017,13-06-2017,2,0.926,5," I'm glad I waited for this model to come out.  I've owned a few VWs with the last one being a 2010 VW Golf 5 spd MT that was VERY reliable but lacked the 4 doors and storage space I needed for extracurricular activities (camping kayaking skiing).  I had cross-shopped Subarus to see what I might be missing and almost bought one for my last car but couldn't find a manual transmission anywhere and the newer ones have mostly phased them out for a CVT.  The outback was nice but when compared to the features I get with the Golf Alltrack and the manual transmission made it much more fun to drive!   Also cost a lot more for similar features.  Now to the alltrack... I just did a 1000 mile road trip and the car drives extremely smooth and when kept to about 70 mpg with a loaded car I was getting 35 mpg.  The car has a perfect amount of storage space.  The only negative would be the back seat is a little smaller than some others but still good for a 6'0"" person in the back as long as you don't try to put 5 people in the car.  It's really much better for 4.   For entertainment I can't get over how good CARPLAY is.  It makes the car so much more enjoyable to use when trying to do navigation listen/find music voice text etc...   I previously had installed a high end Kenwood GPS system in my last car but this is much better/easier to use.   To wrap it up the car handles very well is smooth on the highway and pretty quiet the entertainment system is easy to use and this is an overall great car.  I can't wait til' ski season to try out the 4 wheel drive in the snow but for the time being I'm just enjoying using the car and all it's features!",
2017,21-06-2017,2,0.4922,2, The car does not indicate what gear you are in until the clutch is fully disengaged and the car is moving.  You could be at a traffic signal thinking you are in 1st but really in 3rd and you would not know until the light turns green and you stall out.  Once stalled due to the car being push button start the driver must stomp on the brake quickly to restart the car.  By that time you've been rear-ended.  Thus button start is not compatible with a manual transmission.  The distracted driver electronics (i.e. driver assistance package) is also crap.   A 1/2 hr test drive in city traffic netted only 19.7 mpg.   No thanks  I'll keep my TDI.,
2017,22-06-2017,2,0.9955,4, We did the diesel buyback on our 2009 Sportwagen TDI so we needed a replacement. We selected the Alltrack because it is AWD and is available with a manual transmission. We don't care about the supposed off-road capabilities. But we do live in the Colorado mountains and don't like getting stuck in the snow. For that purpose this car is the perfect compromise because you don't give up good handling economy and comfort which is what you need over 95% of the time.  With the manual transmission we are averaging 29mpg and expect to get in the 30s on trips (Fuelly.com shows that the DSG (automatic) Alltracks average about 3-4 mpg less). The stereo capabilities are impressive. We opted for the S model due to the added level of road noise leaks and breakage we experienced with the panoramic sunroof on our 2009 Sportwagen. This is my first VW without a sunroof since 1983 and I have no regrets about not having the panoramic sunroof. The manual transmission is geared toward fuel economy rather than performance like  a GTI but it is still a pleasure to shift. Between hill hold optionally giving it the gas when starting to prevent stalling turning off the gas when coasting in gear and maintaining the cruise control when shifting shows that VW has carried manual transmissions to the next level. Our biggest gripe was that we were waiting for the manual Alltracks to arrive and we afraid they wouldn't show until after our buyback leaving us without a car. Luckily the new car showed up two weeks before the buyback.,
2017,16-09-2016,3,0.9859,3, I have had the car just a few days an all and all the car is impressive. However after coming out of my214 Ford Edge (42k)  To this car (50k) I feel that VW should've put a little thought into the tech package. I assumed this car was state of the art in tech. The car runs well but I already use google maps to get places. The voice recognition is HORRIBLE.  My 2014 Edge was light years ahead of VW on the Tech side.,
2017,08-07-2017,3,0.6249,2, I bought my car new.  The back door kept making a popping noise every time it was opened and closed. Before I could have it checked I noticed the front door was bent.  They point blank denied  that could happen and flatly refused to repair it.,
2017,11-07-2017,3,0.8658,4, 2013 TDI Jetta turned in to VW and purchased a 2017 GLI - Price paid was the internet price quoted by Edmunds. Dealer got me the car I specified.,
2017,16-07-2017,3,0.9598,5, To start off I would like to say my age 54.   My other vehicles are a 2016 Suzuki dual sport motorcycle and a 2014 Ram 3500 diesel 4x4.  I love all my vehicles.  My 2017 GTI  Sport with the millennial anti theft device (6 spd MT) is just fun to drive.  The little 4 banger has enough ponies to get you on and off the freeway in a hurry.  It is also a blast in the canyons of Southern Calif.    If you are mindful of your speed on the highway she will yield a good 34/35 MPG.   If you want to jump on it and have little fun the MPG do go down which is worth the bad fuel mileage.   The GTI is my weekend fun car.  I purchased it in Nov 2016 and I have been very happy.  People talk a lot of smack about VW reliability.  All I can say is all cars have their limitations.  If you drive your car like an idiot then be prepared for it to take an occasional dump on you.  I don't think you have to baby these vehicles but you can't be dropping the hammer every time you get behind the wheel.    I probably will do two mods to it in time.  Change the exhaust and air box.   From my previous vehicles (Harleys to trucks) changing their air intake makes a big difference in how they perform.  I'm sure this GTI will be the same.,
2017,26-07-2017,3,-0.6309,5, I would buy another one!!,
2017,07-10-2016,4,0.7003,5, This is my second Touareg after driving a 2005 into the ground.  Huge improvements in interior luxury/features and acceleration.  It's about the perfect car for my needs.  Big enough to fit my family of five comfortably though probably not for long drives.  Impressive interior with very high quality parts and styling with beautiful huge oversized sunroof - looks like the Porsche Cayenne it is based on at almost half the price.  Quick steady acceleration for such a heavy car and great ride...I've been sneaking up to 80 or 85 mph accidentally a few times because it rides so smoothly.  The two small issues are 1) no CD player (that is probably me resisting change) and 2) no USB port just bluetooth.  For the CD player there is a media port in the center console that I will try to plug in a portable CD player and see if that works - I'm not ready to retire all of my CDs or take the time to burn all of them to my iPhone.  For the USB I guess I can live with the Bluetooth but you'd think they could drop a USB in the center console. Time will tell on the maintenance and reliability since I've only had it two weeks... fingers crossed.  Otherwise this is an exceptional car that looks great feels great drives great and has about every feature you'd want.  Highly recommend.,
2017,01-11-2016,4,0.9925,5, The R-line has a beautiful sporty design compared to the base S model. The 19in aluminum alloy wheels are stylish and really grip the road allowing for great tight handling; and the R-line's cabin is quiet even with the larger tires. Combined MPG is higher than EPA estimates of city/hwy 23/34 I'm currently getting about 31.5 (half hwy half city). What makes the Passat R-line stand above it's competitors is it's technology and low price. The central info-entertainment system is far superior to it's competitors including the Camry Optima Legacy and Madza 6. Also it comes in a few thousand below the base prices of several of its competitors making it an affordable yet very reliable option. As an added plus is the size of the cabin. It's huge compared to other midsize sedans. Overall very impressive for a vehicle in the low 20s.,
2017,02-11-2016,4,0.6369,5, What we paid for this model was only slightly higer than our 2001 Passart. However they cut back the warranty changed the dash lights to whiteish and it seems there are no drip edges over the doors we got a small puddle on the seat when we opened the doors in the rain. Otherwise the Tech option give you a bunch of toys! Even if some cost money like Car-net and XM radio. But the car overall is great with the tech stuff it makes the car fun and the handleing is totally German so is the quality. Everything fits perfectly! Oh they also cut out option choices you get the package of each model and that's it. If you want to cut out the Sat radio and get Park assist instead with a regular radio it's not gonna happen what's on the advertisements and the sticker is what you get. And as everywhere today there isn't much haggling on the price they have their sales and you get a little off that then they'll add in maintenance and paint protection and tir warranties and they get their full price. Then there was the SEL with lane departure and Park assist for only a couple thousand more!,
2017,02-11-2016,4,0.6908,5, This car is hungry; truly in an almost uncivilized way...to be driven. The 210 hp TSI engine growls like it just wants more road to chew.                                                          The cornering is effortless and quick and the DSG gearing leaves cars in the rear view mirror at an alarming rate. ,
2017,02-11-2016,4,0.9348,5, Simply best in its segment. Test driven many competitors but VW PASSAT definitely stands out. Excellent handling and brakes awesome road experience quality interior great infotainment system catchy design (I leased the R-Line model) and many more. Definitely recommend this car especially with current deals from Volkswagen.,
2017,09-11-2016,4,-0.6249,5, The Jetta GLI is a fairy sporty sedan. It's not the most economical of the Jetta trim levels but offers great acceleration braking and handling. The interior is nice with a good infotainment system parking assistance and blind spot monitoring. I haven't had the car long enough to comment on reliability.,
2017,10-11-2016,4,0.7579,5,Nod to Fender and VW for and even more remarkable sounding stereo then my previous 2012 Fender system. ,
2017,15-11-2016,4,0.9979,5, I had been looking for a new car for months and was thinking Audi or Lexus. I preferred German engineering over all else as I used to own a BMW 328i but decided to sell it before major repairs became a common place situation. I went to my local VW dealer and saw the R Line in Black and realized I preferred the look of this car over the new A4. Took it for a test drive and fell in love. I don't know how the specifications are so low on the engine 170 HP and 184 ft lb torque when it feels like it pulls like a much higher engine. I was extremely impressed by the package and with the incentive acquired the car for slightly over $22k. Insane value. After the past few days I am in love. It's quiet perky handles extremely well fuel efficient and beautiful to look at and sit in. I think VW really has a winner with this one. I look forward to owning this car for awhile.,
2017,18-11-2016,4,0.8832,5, I combined the Pilot insurance money with selling my Miata and now I'm set with a 2017 Jetta SE.  Jus the right size and great gas mileage.  Sanibel white with a sunroof and heat seats.  6-speed automatic gets me from point A to B in plenty of style.,
2017,25-11-2016,4,-0.471,5, I have owned many cars and none of them have been as fun to drive as the GTI.,
2017,26-11-2016,4,0.9784,5," I looked at the 2016 Passat and reviewed it so well my wife let me buy an E300 MB but I can explain. I got the 1989 GLI itch all over again so I purchased a silver 2017 GTI SE. Yep same stuff as the Passat except in a SPORT verses luxury bent platform. I didn't want another E300 but a car that excelled at the opposite end of the car spectrum. I had to have a car that was as economical good or better at hauling stuff more fun to drive and had a better stereo than my 2008 Focus SE. Slam dunk with the GTI. The E300 drives you you drive the GTI 6 speed manual (shifts like butter spreads on a warm day). I can't wait to DRIVE this car same as the 1989 GLI! Something about VW handling that is addictive. The engine is a sweet thing. At idle it simply goes away on you nothing not a quiver. But give it the gas and it talks really nice things to you shift me now. Power with the manual is electric motor linear and STRONG. The front limited slip differential drive system keeps both wheels pulling in snow wet or dry with excellent throttle modulation. The engine is a tiger or a pussycat. Drive it like the 2008 Focus and I get 38-45.5 MPG. Yep same 34 mile route each way as before with the Focus. Drive it like hard like a sports car and still get 28 MPG. The best way to explain this car is that all the pieces are seemingly of the exact same quality level. Nothing irks you to say ""wow that's seems cheap"". OK except that the rear view mirror should be auto dimming weird it isn't. The odometer goes away when you set the cruise as the set speed takes its place weird but not a problem. The instruments are clear and a German conservative white on black LCD illustration. I like it that way too. Everything ergonomically falls right into your hands. I will also say that the interior of the SE NEEDS those Clark Cloth plaid seats or something other than red stitching and a few red lighting accents big time. I am not a fan of black interiors but it is a good black interior. Still give us a two-tone option PLEASE. Oh the seats are superlative for my 155 LBS frame. BIG guys may want to try before you buy. I needed the stereo (OK wanted) and a few other bits I know would make long term ownership nice (ya I paid cash for it).  This is a sports car so the ride is heavenly responsive to the road without being harsh. If you think it rides harshly this isn't your car or any other sport type car. For a sports car it is sublime. Not only does it go really well with near no lag in the turbo (I have the manual so I can drive around it without thinking) or torque steer (the 1989 GLI had PLENTY of that) but it STOPS like NOW with the R series brakes. The green house is WONDERFUL old school lower belt line like the Passat...so you can SEE yet it has five star safety ratings. Bi-Xenon lights are very good not the LED's on the E300 though but way over average. The entertainment is just like my Passat review. It is fast and easy to use with the jump buttons on the side and 100% intuitive touch from there. I've never felt it to be slow or unresponsive. I use a 128GB SD card with WAV file music and the USB for the phone and carplay apps and navigation.  I'm smitten with the overall assembly of this car. OK now the negatives. This is maybe the third EA888 engine iteration. Fixed are the cam chain tensioner issues. Left are likely the longer term carbon on the intake valves common to DI injection engines (no fuel across the intakes to clean them anymore) so a 80000 mile cleaning is in the cards. Not a deal breaker as it is cheaper(~$800.00) to do than a rubber belt cam chain maintenance interval. The PCV valve can fail (this is the latest version that is again supposed to work) and pressurize the crankcase (rear crank seal goes) or pulls a vacuum (oil is pulled through the intake). Turbo engines can be hell on the PCV valve with the boost pressure. But this is a $200.00 part and an easy hour in the garage to fix at 50000 miles. Fix it like an airplane BEFORE it fails. So I'll replace the PCV valve every 50000 and not ever know the original one would have lasted the life of the car. Pity me but it is cheap insurance. Otherwise this engine is to die for. This is a poor excuse for a mid life crisis car it is way too affordable way too practical way too sublimely sexy in appearance and yet still way too much fun. Count me in. The GTI is still the best I drove the rest.",
2017,27-11-2016,4,0.6369,5, I recently leased a 2017 Passat R-Line and I have to say I am surprised by how good it is.  I'm pretty OCD and normally take a long time and make careful decisions.  I cross-shopped it with other mid-size sedans mainly the Honda Accord Toyota Camry Kia Optima Hyundai Sonata Chevrolet Malibu and Ford Fusion.  Basically I rented or test drove all the main mid-sizers except the Subaru Legacy.  In terms of handling the Passat is middling.  It is a bit bouncy and feels just a bit floaty at high speeds (over 80 mph which is normal speed on SoCal freeways when not congested).  Of all of them the best driving were the Mazda 6 Ford Fusion and Honda Accord followed by the Malibu Optima and Passat with the Sonata bringing up the rear.  In terms of comfort however by far the most comfortable was the Passat both for the front seats and especially the crazy large backseats.  It also feels very airy and the sight lines are very good (except to the direct rear where high back headrests intrude a little).  The little 1.8 liter turbo engine is a champ.  It felt at least as powerful as the base engines in the other mid-sizers and more powerful than some.  Yeah its 170 horsepower doesn't sound very impressive but its 184 lb ft of torque is always there and gives really good oomph.  I will check mpg when I've had it for longer.  In terms of technology and infotainment I would say the Passat ranks pretty well but is not the best.  The R-Line has the key safety features I was looking for:  Wide angle rear camera rear cross-traffic alert blind spot monitor and forward collision alert with emergency braking.  The one feature it is missing which I wanted was adaptive cruise control - I would have needed to go up to the SE With Technology for that (I think Edmunds lists it in the normal SE which seems to be a rare error by Edmunds).  One possible safety issue:  The headlights aren't the best.  I have the halogens - the LED headlights are supposed to be a bit better but mine doesn't have them.  I can see fine with the halogens but they aren't very bright and some people might wish for more brightness.  In terms of looks I would say the Passat is attractive from all angles especially the back and side although I think looks are really a matter of personal taste.  Trunk space is very good - 15.9 cubic feet and the space is very functional plus the rear seats fold down 60/40.  The main reason I chose the Passat was that looked at as a whole package I felt better about it than any of the others.  It just feels extremely easy to live with and also feels like a premium car but at a lower price than others on this list.  There is nothing it doesn't do well and some things it does great (did I mention the huge open airy comfortable cabin?  Let me mention it again).  Plus the dealership (Mossy VW in Escondido CA) was more willing to work with me than other dealers.  So I drove off with what I felt was the best car of the bunch at the lowest price of the bunch what's not to like?  It's too new to give any reliability impressions - I might do that after I've had more time with the car.,
2017,29-11-2016,4,0.9863,5, I really enjoy driving this car very precise. Not the flashiest car in the segment but to me it is about function and feel not fashion.,
2017,30-11-2016,4,0.2247,5, I have owned a number of GTIs but have to say this is probably the best one ever. The sport is a stand alone model that includes the performance pack Nogaro alloys (Only on Sport model) bi-xenon/LED lighting keyless entry/ignition over the base S model. Plus Apple play is a great feature negating the need for navigation. For me and I am sure other enthusiasts agree that this is the perfect model - why? The new MQB platform GTI is a an incredibly well-developed car that drives and handles superbly. The Sport has all the essentials needed without the superfluous toys added in the SE and Autobahn models - this is the enthusiasts GTI. The addition of the Performance packs adds some extra horsepower but the real bonus of the package is the mechanical limited slip differential which takes cornering on a front-drive car to a new level and the stopping power of the R brake package. The beauty of the GTI has always been the fact that it is such a versatile and well-behaved car when you want it to be but when you want to push it to it limits it is in an even happier mode. I love the fact that this car is so capable in so many areas - it may well be the perfect car!,
2017,02-12-2016,4,0.9703,5,"Things I miss from my 2009 no locking glove box no AC outlet in the back (built in inverter).  The interior is ""cheaper"" but the features like Apple Car Play Backup Camera and Heated Seats are very nice.  39MPG on highway trip.",
2017,07-12-2016,4,0,5, I have owned many makes and models this is one of the best buys out there.,
2017,08-12-2016,4,-0.8727,5, I was in the auto business for 30 years.As far as I am concerned if you can find a nicer overall new car buy it quickly.This auto is the se with the tech pkg. It is the nicest riding and handling auto I have driven in my 30 years in the business.Ithas great interior room and a giant trunk.The seats have piping on that make the interior look much more expensive then it is.It feels rock solid and almost gets hybrid fuel economy .The dealer has drawings for dinners and details. I get compliments on the looks where ever I go and it!s made in America.,
2018,29-05-2017,2,0.9659,5," My wife and I had been looking for a new SUV for the last few months.  I'm a pretty big guy at 6'2"" and about 245lbs so spaciousness is a big concern for me.  After driving the pathfinder highlander 4 runner and pilot nothing compared to the space I have in the Atlas.   It's a very comfortable ride and has great features that I've never had in a car before.  The lane assist park assist and ACC work awesome but take a bit of getting used to.   The sound system sounds great even without the top of the line Fender system.  In addition the apple car play interface works great!   My only concern with it is that it doesn't seem to let you search for specific sounds in iTunes unless you have it in a playlist.  I may be wrong on this as I've just began to play with it.   All in all we have been very happy with the car so far.   Time will see how well it's reliability holds up but with VWs 72000 mile warranty on this car we figured it was well worth a try.",
2018,05-06-2017,2,0.9688,5, I just purchased my Atlas about two weeks ago. I love the size of the vehicle and for its size it handles nicely. If I put it in sport mode acceleration is lively and adequate. In normal mode acceleration is fine. The technology for the adaptive cruise control and lane keeping is amazing and although it took me a few weeks to figure everything out it never ceases to amaze. The parking assist features work nicely as well. I use it for commuting in Houston and hauling the family around on weekends. Can't wait to take it on a long road trip. I would highly recommend this vehicle.,
2018,17-06-2017,2,0.7964,2, Wtf this vehicles technology is junk. How can they possible consider it a technology edition when doesn't even come with a  garage door opener. I am a andriod user and expect the technology to blend seamlessly however this is not the case.  I am still waiting for manufactures to give up on their proprietary software and use opensource so the professionals can give the people exactly what they want. What I want is a display that mirrors my phone exactly is that too much to ask. I have this in my 2006 toyota solara it can be done. This is my first day owning this vehicle that makes my KIA Optima look like a Lexus. The interior is barebones sure it has leather and holds 8 people but I think I would have enjoyed a Buick Enclave more. Now I have 3 yrs of lease on a genaric POS. I had high hopes and now believe I made a huge mistake.,
2018,19-06-2017,2,0.9865,4, First I love this car it's comfort style and maneuverability.  It fits my kids and I perfectly and we have really enjoyed it.  I also have nothing but great things to say about everyone we have come in contact with at VW.  They all have been very helpful.  I am however extremely disappointed in the fact that our car has been in the service department twice already.  The first time was for loose bolts on the sway bar which caused extreme front in knocking/grinding sounds and rough handling.  The second time was for a check engine light that came on.  The diagnostic report stated that it had something to do with an air leak to the engine.  Currently it is at the dealership for this and I don't have more information yet.  I was hesitant to write this review as I generally don't like to comment with negative feedback but thought it would be worthwhile if it helps someone else in making their decision when purchasing a car.  My dad purchased this car for us with the hopes that my kids and I would be driving something reliable and safe and unfortunately so far that has not proved to be true.  I'm very bummed out about our purchase for this reason.,
2018,22-06-2017,2,0.9493,3, The car is intentionally stripped down in the most offensive fashion. E.g. take heating/AC:  ,
2018,23-06-2017,2,-0.2167,5, This is a huge SUV. It seats 7 people comfortably with some space left over for your stuff. Technology is awesome ACC lane keeping assist blind spot monitoring auto headlights auto windshield wipers all work flawlessly. It is the best value for the money out there in the mid-size SUV market right now (June/2017). Since it is a new project safety ratings should be above average for the class too when IIHS ratings come out.,
