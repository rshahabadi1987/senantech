1990,26-02-2002,1,0.9828,4.5,Some might find this funny. But its acceleration is quite impressive. Size: it can seat 5. And if you park it next to a coupe. It will still look more compact. This car just makes you smile. Its something else. Ageless design.,
1990,27-02-2002,1,0.4215,3.875,I've owned it since 2001 (second owner) and other than oil changes batteries and headlights I've never had to have any work done on it.,

1990,11-03-2010,1,-0.509,4.375, I have two Toyota Camrys. We liked the 1990 so much we bought a 1991. Essentially their twins... except one is a manual shift one an automatic. My wife wishes it would die so she could get a new one.,
1990,14-03-2010,1,0.5093,5, This vehicle is what gave Toyota the great reputation it enjoyed for 20 yrs until the recall problems today! Last spring I had the engine rebuilt and installed it myself to enjoy it for the next 20 yrs as it gets 20 mpg city & 34 mpg hwy! (Manual transmission) 5 spd!,
1990,01-01-2016,1,0.9382,5, Bought my 1990 4dr Corolla (base model no power anything) in 2014 for $865 as my first car. It wasn't in terrible condition but it had been sitting so all four tires were dry-rotted. I replaced the front two to avoid slipping in the winter serviced transmission performed an oil change and performed a tune up. With a couple hundred dollars into it it was running fine and continues to do so despite being 26 years old now. There is an exhaust leak the door handle fell off once and one night the battery terminal literally broke in half and disconnected itself while driving. Fixed it the next day with a $5 dollar one from Auto Zone and everything was back to normal. I've put ~10K miles on it in a little over a year. Being an 18-year-old boy it definitely isn't the most exciting thing to drive for me but it gets me where I need to go with around 30 MPG as I drive like a granny in town. Purely based on value it's a better one than any other first car I could've chosen. There was no other car I could've bought that would have cost this little and still work reliably every day.,

1990,02-06-2005,2,0,4.5, The 3.0 L V6 is one of the worst engines ever made there are serious problems with the head gaskets. I own one and it has gone through 2 head gaskets in less than 200000 miles at a cost of $1500 to $1800 each time. Do not buy these vehicles! Toyota will only replace the gasket one time but refuses to accept that it is a design flaw not only a gasket problem.,
1990,25-04-2007,2,0,4.375, At the age of 17 big red has over 290000 miles on her. Great for bopping around town or on long hauls. Never any problems from defects except the original radiator-pin leak on top (but we were at 220000 miles!). Have only had to do the timing belt twice clutch and brakes once and minor tuneup tweaks. Just keeping the fluids clean pays off! Safety is awesome;stopped in traffic on the freeway I was rear-ended at 53 mph. Everyone fine in truck tire on rear took the force though the tire bracket was bent into the truck window still went up and down fine.,
1990,01-05-2008,2,-0.1716,4.75,It is pretty reliable though and I am glad I have it. It is paired with a 1995 Toyota Corolla my main vehicle. This 4Runner was built during a time when Toyota stood for quality!  Twenty-five years old and running strong.,

1990,19-05-2008,2,0.7845,4.625,I have learned how to drive it. It isn't very powerful so I have to take it out of overdrive to climb hills and I can't count on just pulling out in traffic (it doesn't accelerate well). The gas mileage is surprisingly poor: 13-17 mpg. I need new seals in the engine as well but that's just age.,

I can't even find a kbb value for a 1990 but mine still looks pretty good and only has 140000. miles. It needs a little work now but for 6 years I didn't put a drop of money into her except oil changes.,

1990,25-08-2010,3,0,4.375,I also own an 07 Subaru legacy and I actually keep it in the garage most of the time because there's no point putting miles on it while the Camry still runs perfectly.,

1990,28-11-2008,4,0,4.875, I have had my 4Runner for 10 years now having bought it used with 75000 miles on it. It scared me at first because I thought I was driving a truck after owning a small Honda Civic. This baby has been through thick and thin with me. I have used as a true SUV and not a show car like I've seen in California. Some have complained of now guts or power. I have the V6 engine with a 5 speed and have NO complaints. The 4 wheel drive works like a charm. I wouldn't own an automatic in a SUV (show car) and I have 250000 on it and I'm considering a rebuild before it dies. I love this car!,
1990,01-11-2010,4,-0.3495,4.5, Love this car. Bought it in 2005 with 30000 miles on it. Did not realize what I was getting into when bought this car. Drove this car to Los Angeles and back a few times. Easy. Filled up twice. For 700 miles. I mean come on. Being a '90 model with a top speed on 110 mph. This car can actually reach that speed. I find that very impressive. Acceleration is outstanding and really just very fun to drive. Lots of great memories in the car and I recently crossed 85000. I expect this bad boy to be with me for a while. Not a scratch. Not a tear. Everything is functioning. And body in pristine condition. Real lucky to drive this car. Will take care of it as much as it takes care of me.,

1991,31-03-2011,1,0,4.375, I bought my 1991 Land Cruiser in Oct of 2009 with just over 120K on the odometer (a rare find indeed). Although not perfect the pros definitely outweigh the cons especially when you consider this is a 20 year-old used vehicle. Toyota quality is impeccable as expected; this truck will run forever if you treat it right and do all the correct maintenence. Things are going to break on a 20 year-old vehicle and it isn't going to be cheap but compared to anything else out there that's 20 years-old the problems are minimal. If you want a go-anywhere vehicle that can seat 7 and last a lifetime look no further than the Toyota Land Cruiser.,
1991,05-03-2014,1,0.6943,5, This car is a wild beast. There is literally NOTHING the 4runner can't handle. My friends and I have taken her through streams rock climbing mudding and playing in the snow. I am so mean to this car yet it has never once failed me. It keeps going no matter what you throw at it. Lots of room reliable engine and it just looks so bad ass! I think it's important that you get the manual version though because automatics aren't as much fun and don't give as much control. If you want a car that will keep trooping past 250k miles this is the one for you. Take care of it and you will love it forever.,

Although the initial investment to get it running right cost a lot I could not be happier. In the time since then I have added a new paint job all original new tires battery and went through the interior to replace missing parts. One modification I would tell everyone to do is switch it to partial 4WD this allows for 2WD during the the summer or non-bad weather/roads. I bought my kit for the front differential and hubs from Australia for about $500 and the labor brought everything to under $1000.00. This has saved me tons of money. It goes anywhere.,

I have had to do only one head job on it but that was a dealership recall. I love it how this truck can go anywhere anytime. It has the perfect amount of cargo room mostly when you fold down the rear seats. This truck is perfect in an offroad environment too. I can definitely keep up with all the other guys in there souped up trucks in the sand. If your looking for a fun truck that lasts a life time and maybe even longer this should be your truck.  ,

For a 16 year old car with 149K on it it's extremely reliable! The car averages 29-30 mpg in the city and 36-37 mpg on the highway. Only a few minor maintenance issues in the nearly six years I've owned it. Despite it's dated styling considering its performance I simply can't justify the expense of replacing it with a new car. Mine is a wagon and I wish Toyota would still offer new Corolla wagons in the US. Crossovers and SUV/s don't get the same mileage as plain old wagons.  If you're looking for a reliable used car definitely put the Corolla at the top of your list!,

It is extremely reliable in fact we have never been stranded in this car.  It takes whatever you do to it even inconsistency in maintenance. The body is rusting around the wheel wells but the car runs like the day we bought it.   We are looking to buy another Toyota since this car came out before air bags and we think we should have them for safety.  We bought this car when our daughter was in pre-school.  She is now in college.  It is a part of the family!  We will hate to see it go but hope we can find another Toyota just as good.,

Under the hood is simple the interior is comfortable - it's no lexus but it works. The air conditioner stays cold and the rear defrost works like new even after all these years. The only bad thing I can say is the handles break easy in the cold but anything plastic will do that.,

1993,15-01-2010,1,0,4.5, This has been great truck / SUV.  I have never had any electrical problems that others may have experienced.  I have 257000 miles on it - original engine water pump starter and alternator.  Engine and trans have never been apart.  Regular maintenance keeps her running.,
1993,07-06-2007,2,-0.4404,4.375, Former 1991 4runner owner and bitter at that after discovering I owned the worst engine Toyota ever built and having vowed never to own a Toyota again.  Our old but new to us 1993 Land Cruiser proves why Toyota is the top automaker. We found our LC after driving new used and all possible choices between. After a friend told me the old LC's are great trucks and can go 200+K with no major failures we took a reluctant look at the beast. A week later we found a 1993 for sale by original owner wife driven 8000 miles or less per year all 100K maint already done. We bought the old LC and have been impressed ever since. Great truck smart engineering - true Toyota quality. ,

1993,18-08-2004,3,0.9698,4.625,Being able to haul all our stuff and friends in decent comfort drives like a champ compared to American SUV's with 100+K - truth be told it drives better than most new American SUV's minus the occasional stiff jolt from the solid front and rear axles.,
1993,20-08-2005,3,0,4.5, I can't rave enough about this vehicle. I would upgrade to a newer model but this is a fun off-road and on-road vehicle. Only drawback is taking out a loan to go to the gas station.,
1993,13-09-2005,3,0.6652,4.5,All-around great quality tank.,
1993,07-08-2006,3,0.5719,4.375, Have owned the Cruiser since 1994. Have fallen in love with its brutish design and it's great fun driving it off road. I drive it on the sand all summer and town the boat all around the Cape. I couldn't have asked for a better car. It still runs great despite the odd repair here and there. I recommend for all who have the money to buy one.,
1993,27-09-2007,3,-0.4767,4.625,It has always provided a tremendous feeling of safety - especially in driving during inclimate weather.,

1994,08-05-2009,2,0,4.625, I truly enjoy my car and am so proud to drive it. It drives smooth and great rocky terrain.  It's soo spacious and easy to maneuver. But as a college student I'm looking for something smaller now. ,

1994,13-09-2008,3,-0.3612,4.75, This truck purchase has been a great investment.  Its body style is timeless - I'm often told by people they think it's 8-10 years newer.  Hauling 8 people around is a great feature.  It tows my trailer and camper around as if there is nothing behind it.  The gas mileage is not anything to write home about but that's about the only negative aspect.  My wife loves it!  I try to put her and my kids in it when there is snow/ice on the ground.  The 4 wheel drive has great traction and I feel very safe when I put my family in it.  Great decision to buy! ,

1995,28-03-2002,1,0,4.75, The Land Cruiser is the ultimate in that it is legendarily reliable at all times.  It is as comfortable in the city (power economy ride size braking etc.) as any other SUV but the ultimate off-road.  It is very steady and built like a tank.,

1995,12-05-2004,2,0,4.5, Just bought this 1995 with 98150 on the clock.  Unbelieveable how tight and rattle free this is.  I am an ex 1999 Chevy Tahoe owner and while the Tahoe has more interior room and power it lacks the manners handling and off road capability that the older Toyota has.  I understand that this is the last year of the really heavy duty suspension.  So far I would buy this vehicle again and again.  ,

1996,17-03-2009,1,0,4.125, I bought this car with almost 90000 miles I was a little nervous buying a used car with so many miles and for $15k.  I have now owned this car for 5 years and now have 140000miles there is a reason why these truck are legendary the are build strong and made to last.  This car is more comfortable than many newer cars and extremely reliable and excellent in the snow.  Other than some minor repairs and bad gas mileage the car will last forever.  I use this truck for everything from family trips to towing the boat to daily commuting like I said it is built to last.,
1996,04-04-2003,2,0.3612,4.25, Bought the Land Cruiser because I heard of its great reliability.  Its been a good car able to haul kids up skiing and having no trouble with snow.  My problem is maintenance.  It goes through brake pads and rotors.  Second set of rotors in 80000 miles.  Also had the head gasket blow out in Vail which was extremely expensive.  Spent far more on maintenance on this car than any other I've owned including my Fords.  I leave it in the garage except to haul kids skiing.  Think I got the LC Lemon.,
1996,28-06-2005,2,0.3612,4.375, I purchased this vehicle used in 1998 with 38000 miles. I bought my first Land Cruiser an FJ40 in 1976 and my first wagon in 1978. You cannot beat the durability and reliability of this vehicle. It handles very well rides smooth and quiet on road and will go just about anywhere offroad when needed. It will never leave you stranded.,

Surfing out of the way spots is a piece of cake.  Driving in snowdrifts -  no problem.  Pulling up to the finest restaurants - you feel totally comfortable and stylish.

1997,01-03-2002,1,0.4019,4.75,The problem with this suv is that its so good you don't want to let it go. I have put 335000 miles on it. It drives better than many new suvs coming right off the showroom. The only repairs in 15 years have been 1 radiator and 1 alternator. The power antenna just got tired of going up and down so now it just stays up. I had to re-upholster my two front leather seats a year ago due to normal wear and tear.,
1997,20-02-2003,1,0.4019,4.625," How do I say ""I AM GLAD I DID"". I did my research and made my purchase.  If you enjoy getting into those hard to reach places where only few can travel;  This is definitely the vehicle for you.  Everything the write up's say are only speaking from the tip of the ice berg. I have traveled from my home in the highland deserts of SoCal to the even higher lands above Estes Park Colorado which was in the 11000 ft above sea level range. I presently live in North Western Louisiana. Believe me when I say that my Cruiser has been there.  It presently has just over 300000 miles on it and runs like new.  Thank You Toyota.",
1997,03-06-2003,2,0.4215,4.75,"If you are a tall person this may not be the car for you. There is not a lot of ""leg room"" in the front seat. I hear that there is an adjustment that can be done for more leg room but...  I also wish my 97 had a little more tow capacity. It is 5000 lbs. But I am willing to sacrifice. 98 and later models get to 6500. ",
1997,04-05-2005,2,0.8881,4.75,I love the handling of the LC it handles just as good or better than a car. And I love that I have so many speakers. If I had anymore I would be at a concert. I like the tank feeling and as you can see I could go on and on.,
1997,10-06-2006,2,0.7269,4.625,Gas mileage. For new price circa $40000 poorly executed interior!! More HP!! Better weight distribution. Heavy. Brakes sluggish. Rear window doesn't roll. ,
1997,06-06-2007,2,0.1471,4.25," Bought used in 03/2006 with 145000 miles. With lockers condition collector's edition had to purchase it. So far no mechanical/major problems but the AC stopped working. $900 to fix leak on condensor!! The reliability and the ""guts"" of the Cruiser are unmatchable. Snow rain no problem. Confident ride in such conditions. Fun to drive in nice fall weather. Windows roll all the way down. Huge sunroof. This vehicle will get you from point A to point B no doubt. However it'll cost you 11-13 mpg. The ownership expenses add up: insurance oil gas tranny fluid diff fluid larger tires. Basically if you have excess spare cash to burn a very reliable superb vehicle!",
1997,30-06-2007,2,0.9236,4.5,All features are great.,

1997,25-05-2016,2,0.4939,5,The best part about this car is that every part no matter how big or small has been massively over manufactured. Every bolt  screw has been manufactured as if money was not an object. This truck does not need a road. Awesome feeling when you are off the road or in snow conditions. It even has a differential lock that allows maneuvering it out of rough terrains even though I have never used it knowing I have it makes me feel better. The transmission is something else. I have never had any transmission problems. ,
1997,30-08-2005,3,0.3182,4.5, I bought my LC new in 1997. It is the BEST car I have ever had. It now has 276000 miles and I have not had to hardly do any repair work other than oil changes (I do it every 3000 miles) brakes and tires. I was told this 6 cylinder engine should be trouble free for 500000 miles or more so my high mileage so far has not scared me. The only things that have given me trouble was the automatic car antenna and one of the little gadgets that extend out to electronically bend the front back seat. It does 15-16 mpg of regular fuel. The newer land cruisers with V8 do 14mpg with premium fuel. I recommend this car if you can get one with 100-150000 miles it's a better buy than a new car.,
1997,01-09-2010,3,0.9783,4.375, Bought it around 2 years ago with 150k on it so far only had to change the rear 02 sensor and some normal wear items.   The only thing I don't like on this LC is the driver seat can't never find a comfortable position.  ,
1997,08-08-2014,3,0.6249,4.875, I bought this car with 94K and I am currently at 102k and my goal is to go half a million miles with this amazing car. I absolutely love this car. Its got this best engine ever made. Never ever gives up and will chug through just about any type of weather mother nature throws at it. Its 4x4 capabilities and high clearance makes me feel comfortable in any situation. I live in a thick mountain area and at -21 degrees it starts right up. This car is reliable and worth every penny! Plus it just looks amazing! Very unique compared to most other vehicles. This car will be around for my kids and grandkids.,
1997,28-10-2005,4,0.0274,5,I cant think of any improvements. I recommend if you are going to buy an older Landcruiser 1997 is the year you want because all the kinks of prior years were taken care of. Make sure that all parts especially the engine and transmission are genuine. Once you get out of the original Landcruiser parts I doubt they would be as reliable,
1997,30-11-2005,4,0.3912,4.625," I love the feeling of driving my LC. And knowing that the reliability is second to none. Chevy has the saying ""like a rock"" and I love knowing that I can climb right over that rock!! I Have 140k+ miles on it and I know that I will be able to get that many more out of it.  ",
1997,10-12-2005,4,0.207,4.75,The mileage is always the same 15 to 16mpg regular gas no matter if you are going up hill or downhill. I joke to my friends this truck will do 16mpg even if its parked. ,

1997,20-12-2009,4,0.0386,4.875,Drive like a tank can go anywhere is a true statement from all LC owners. ,
1997,23-10-2012,4,0.9531,5, Bought this car with 190000 miles. It is now at 270000 miles. My only repair was a new radiator which I probably could have skipped but was on vacation with family and didn't want to chance it. Like previous reviewers the wife and I fought over this car although we had a newer one with less miles sitting in the driveway! I will definitely be buying another land cruiser. Although mileage is poor you make up for it with lack of repairs. Truly a pleasure to drive. Also like the previous reviewer we got rid of a Jeep Grand Cherokee to buy this. That car was always in the shop. Not the land cruiser. Wonderful car.,
1997,25-10-2012,4,0.6486,4.625,Head gasket seems to be a common issue before you go buy one make sure you have it check out.,

1998,18-03-2002,1,0.4404,4.75, Our Crusher was given to us by relatives that used it as a parking lot princess.  In 10 years it had been dinged scraped dirtied and unloved as it was a family workhorse.  NY winters did not help.  NO scheduled maintenance ever just generic oil changes tires and brakes every so often. $4K later (a bargain!) it looks and rides just like new.  Best of all it has only 60K on the clock!  Even after 10 years of short trips and substandard preventative maintenance this LC still runs like new!  This vehicle is rock-solid and it's reputation precedes it making my analysis superfluous. ;-),

1998,12-03-2005,1,0.8519,4.5, I have owned this truck for 1.5 years and it had 67000 miles on it. This SUV is awesome! We test drove all comparable SUV's this size.  The Navigator Expedition and Sequoia. We were close to buying a newer Sequoia (2001) however we chose an older Land Cruiser (1998). The Luxury and ride of the Land Cruiser sold us. The 3rd seat is a little tighter than we would like but is great to have when we are carpooling friends (seats 8). I drive this SUV everywhere and have never been disappointed in it's performance.   ,
1998,03-01-2010,1,0,4.625, Did the research in 2002 bought a 1998 TLC with 54000 miles on it from a dealer that picked it up off auction as a lease return.  This is one fantastic vehicle.  The whole is greater than the sum of the parts in this case.  The engine is not powerful by today's standards but quite adequate.  The cabin space is not enormous but very comfortable.  It will go anywhere out climb the Hummers leave the jeeps in the gullies etc. Handles snow and ice like a dream even on 13% grades in the mountains.  Locking differentials are a great option.  Maintenance cost in minimal; I put a starter in at about 100000 miles.  Like it so much I bought a 2nd one in 2006.  Keeping this one too though.,

1999,16-01-2007,1,0,4.25, I bought mine off of ebay and it needed work right off that the guy neglected to tell me about. After getting the work done by my husband I have to say I love this SUV. It has tons of rust underneath being originally from OH but even so it hasn't let me down for a minute. My husband wants it for himself but it's mine and I plan to run it to 400K hopefully. Nothing beats no car payments.,
1999,15-02-2007,1,0.6573,4.875, Waited a long time for an L/C.  Finally got it for my 40th b-day.  Traded LS 400 - also awesome.  The L/C is the best vehicle I have ever owned.  Total confidence with this L/C.  Bought with 65K now @ 110K and you can't hear it run.   Best vehicle for a family kids dog anything.  Just put new shocks on it and it rides like new.  I wish it had a little more towing capacity as I occasionally tow a 6500, Airstream.  Love this truck... it was worth the wait!
1999,16-02-2009,1,0,4.375, 145K engine/tranny never skips a beat paint still looks 95% new interior indestructible tackles anything asked of it and at 10 years old people still comment on how incredible it looks and can't believe it's a 99:)  The fuel economy is poor but I'm guessing if you're looking at the Cruiser you're more concerned with safety ride quality dependability and bring me anywhere and return me safe-ability.  It is for lack of better wording an incredible vehicle.,

1999,17-09-2011,3,0,5, Comfortable on long highway drives yet will cover just about any bad terrain. Great vehicle in the snow. Plush interior. I bought this car with about 30K on the odo and now have about 100K. Still feel like new. Very few problems other than 02 sensors (2) and a couple of minor things. The power antenna tends to break but is cheap to fix. Stereo is not the greatest. Wood interior trim discolors with time.  Beware though that if you do have a mechanical problem parts are outlandishly expensive. A new master key from the dealer runs $250.,
1999,29-07-2015,3,0,5, I had this LC for about 10 years now and it's still running like a Champ!  The only thing I've replaced were Battery Brake Pads and Starter and off course your regular oil/air filter maintenance.  I took this LC almost everywhere and have put about 150K miles since I got it.  It has 200K miles now and still running strong.  Engine is very powerful for it's class.  I believe it will still outlast some of the new SUV's around.,

1999,11-10-2016,4,-0.2023,5, This is an extremely reliable comfortable and useful vehicle. As close to maintenance free as any car you can own. Built like a tank but rides like a Cadillac. After 10 years all electronics and mechanics are working perfectly. Leather is holding up great. Unstoppable in snow and mud. I wish it got a little better than 13-14 mpg though. Still would never get rid of it. This thing will go 400k miles.,

It does get only 16-17MPG tops but gas mileage is not why I purchased. It is the most reliable vehicle I have ever owned; it's solid it's safe. I just picked up today from having routine maintenance; my mechanic says there is nothing wrong with it! Change the timing belt every 60K change the oil every 4K do a tune up every 75K use Michelin's and they will drive forever. I have a friend with the same model with >300K and it still runs great! I have driven the Appalachians to the Tetons on road extreme off road and it has never let me down! Mine forever!,

2000,02-04-2005,2,0,5, I just ordered my third new Land Cruiser (2007 model).  At 110250 miles my 2000 handled better drove tighter and was a smoother ride than every test drive we took of other comparable 2007 SUVs. The Land Cruiser has only needed two repairs (a starter and CD electrical problem) all these miles. It has reliably gotten me out of sticky situations numerous times ranging from snow packs in the Rockies to an approaching hurricane on the Florida Coast. The third seats are not as comfortable but are great for hauling my daughter's middle school basketball team.  The seats all easily tuck away in several formations for hauling everything from small trees to luggage. We couldn't go anywhere else.,

My wife's only complaint is she wishes the steering wheel was adjustable. Put the original equipment Michelin tires on it... they will go 60k+ miles. ,
2000,30-07-2009,3,0.6486,4, I bought this SUV in 2000 new.  I knew it was expensive compared to other SUV's but my 1996 Chevy Tahoe stranded my family and I for the third time in VT and I was willing to pay more for reliability.  Almost ten years later and this is by far the best vehicle I have ever owned.  105000 miles and it runs and rides like new.  Unlike my newer VW Passat and the Tahoe predecessor the TLC does not leak any engine oil or any other fluids on my garage floor to this day.  Only negatives are 16 mpg (no matter how you drive); very expensive parts when they fail; awkward third row seat arrangement; chews through tires at the front end (latest Michelins are holding up better than others). Best SUV!,

2001,03-02-2010,1,0,3.5," I bought this after owning a 2002 Yukon. Although I would imagine the reliability of the Toyota is better the need for premium fuel on top of dismal fuel economy is annoying.  Contrary to what another reviewer wrote there are very few places to put things on the console so sunglasses and stuff just hang around the shifters.  I am 6'3"" and there is insufficient leg room for a vehicle this size. Also the fold down rear seat does not disappear like in the Yukon blocking 1 1/2 feet of space - can't sleep in back  On the plus side the traction control is amazing and saved us from a half- way spin-out in the snow last year.",

2001,20-06-2008,2,0.6369,4.625, Bought used 12/03 w/27K miles; now just over 120000 & though overdue a major check-up & first tune-up I've had few problems.  Mileage still avgs. 20-21 mpg & might improve a bit once tuned.  Except for routine maint. have only  had to replace some sort of emissions sensor.  Ck engine light came on a few times at first but once I realized it was always right after oil change & they weren't reconnecting an air hose properly after ckg the air filter I always warn them about it & it hasn't happened since.  Htg&A/C intermittently switches over to opposite of what it's set on.  Turning temp. knob over & back resets it so haven't fixed since entire panel must be pulled - big $$$ I'm told,
2001,22-05-2010,2,0,4.875, Buying a first year production SUV scared me a bit and I questioned my decision making process.  Boy was I wrong!  Over the last 9+ year our Highlander has never failed or given me any reason to curse the brand.  Outside of regular maintenance out highlander has stood the test of time.  I will say that tires wear out faster due to AWD but outside of that and the pathetically weak front cup holders I am glad with my decision.  If you do a lot of highway driving this car is a pleasure to drive.  ,

2001,06-09-2006,3,0.4404,4.875, The TLC is the standard by which all SUVs are judged. Reliability comfort safety and durability for the long haul are superior to any other vehicle I've owned. The overall integrity of the TLC outweighs others in its class. We moved out of the minivan market into a large SUV to satisfy our family needs - performance & safety were tops on our list. After initial sticker shock cost comparisons revealed the reasons behind the price tag. Driving confirms the value everytime we travel the Autobahn or Autostrada.,
2001,22-08-2010,3,0.5719,4.875, We bought our Highlander with 50k miles 5 years ago and have put over 80k additional miles on it. It is the most reliable car we have ever owned. It has great performance decent fuel economy comfortable ride and is a nice looking car as well. I would recommend it to anyone regardless of mileage.

2001,30-07-2014,3,0,4.875,As much as I love the car I'll admit that the cost of repairs and the type of repairs have gotten me. Grant it I've had to pay quite the number on getting it repaired I would say most of it was basically 'wear and tear' I am the 2nd owner and most of the original parts lasted well over 110000 miles so I've been footing the bill. My a/c went out withing 6 months had to pay $1200 to repair. Most recently my altenator went bad along with this other issue (can't remember) but combined that cost me $1200 and now I'm paying $1700 to have my 02 sensors (somethign i've read in reviews that go bad (denso brand)) valve cover gaskets AND fuel injector replaced. On average i've speant maybe $2000 or so a year on repairs. And I've also had to have my tired changed twice. ,
2001,16-07-2016,3,0,5, I purchased this vehicle in 2006 with about 75000 miles on it and added 69000 miles of my own. Initially I was in love with it but that soon faded away very quickly because in addition to my routine maintenance At least twice a year I had to make major repairs on it such as replacing the rotors steering column air conditioning panel suspension etc...The mpg states that its 19/25 but thats far from the truth because I usually averaged 16 mpg regardless of street or highway mileage and when exceeding about 50 mph there was an annoying whistling sound that leads you to believe your windows are open when they're not. At my wits end and ready to purchasde another vehicle,
2001,20-10-2002,4,-0.4118,3.625, Average meaning I would not buy another one. At 75k miles it leaks oil and needs a rear seal ($3000) it uses oil on the highway it has an odd whistling noise that no one can find (when going against the wind on the highway) the gas mileage is NOT good. The only reason we still have it is because my wife likes it. ,

Now I fill it once per week. I was told it was either a cheap part or the rings in the motor. I am getting a second opinion but am heartbroken. I cannot afford the loan plus getting a brand new motor. I really do love the vehicle but not with this price. ,

2004,18-10-2003,4,0.3182,5, Look anyone who owned or currently owns Landcruisers should be fairly well-versed with them. Everyone knows of their reliability & craftsmanship areas where they are 2nd to none. No doubt they are huge and ponderous to drive and like any other large SUV are big boxes in the wind that return poor gas mileage. However for pure reliability and comfort toyota comes thru. This is a pricey vehicle no doubt and you would expect memory seats and a more appointed interior but a true toyota buyer does his homework thoroughly up front and knows their strength is in the fact that you will own this vehicle for years to come and when you move on most likely your loyalty will remain with toyota     ,

2004,19-12-2010,4,0.2732,4.875, If you purchase the Land Cruiser for its intended use it cannot be beat. For low maintenance and off road on road ability it cannot be beat in the long run. It is not intended to be a grocery getter. All are built in Japan and intended to last 300k miles. They are shipped all over the world for tough off road conditions. Enjoy your Cruisers. I have owned 5 throughout the years. Do your research and you will not be disappointed. Look at the vehicles diplomats are escorted in dangerous situations around the world and you will notice a large majority are the Cruisers.,

2005,22-06-2005,2,0,4.875, This my 5th Land Cruiser.  I was going to switch to the LX 470 but decided that my 4 and 7 year old boys could spill milkshakes and ketchup in a Land Cruiser just as easy as in a Lexus!  Great vehicle.  I bought this one sight unseen at the end of the year and didn't get the exact interior package that I wanted but that's not big deal.,
2005,22-06-2005,2,0.0258,4.875, We bought our LC in the winter of 2005 and had Toyota not made the new ones look like overgrown Highlanders we would have bought a new one.  This is the single best vehicle I have ever owned.  I have driven it as a commuter on long road trips and even camped in it and it has exceeded expectations in every scenario.  I also love the interior appointments and the stateliness of the exterior styling and think of it as everything the Range Rover should be without the constant trips to the shop. With more than 5 years of ownership the only times it has been in the shop have been to repair body damaged caused by my wife's impatience and routine maintenance.,
2005,06-06-2009,2,0.8999,5,Never had a single problem with it. Nothing.  NB I looked at Range Rovers (then $25k more) and the LX 470 (then $9k more). Looking now used car value of the Range Rover is the same as the Land Cruiser and the LX 470 is only $2k more - so the extra cash would have virtually evaporated over time.,
2005,03-06-2010,2,0.784,4.5, We purchased it in the summer of 2005 and have taken it on cross country trip over endless NYC potholes and off road.

2006,26-02-2007,1,0.4404,3.75, Overall generally pleased with this vehicle and hope it is as reliable as everyone says but...   After driving for a few months I am disappointed in the lack of some basic features one would expect in a $60K luxury SUV.  Very basic and bland vehicle and becoming extremely dated in its offering. I have nicknamed it the dinosaur.,
2006,07-04-2007,2,0.965,4.875,Performance both on and off road. Reliability all body motor and transmission elements are sturdy and seem built to last. Comfort is excellent except for air conditioning. Road holding is excellent. Sound isolation is excellent and allows full enjoyment of radio and CD  player. ,
2006,08-09-2008,3,-0.8885,4, I purchased the long bodied 8-seater and although this car is no beauty to look at it is the best car I've ever owned and most certainly the best of my SUVs.  Because it is a diesel powered car the fuel consumption is much better than the gas models. It has great stability and efficiently corrects any tendency to sway in speedy curves.  Design is extremely sturdy and strong but heavy acceleration is remarkably good.  Service prices are quite reasonable. Rational design allows for very fast service and time/mileage between required service is highly competitive.,

2007,07-02-2008,1,-0.3412,4.625, $64000 was the price and I question why I layed down that much money for this vehicle.  It is nice don't get me wrong but not even close to nice enough for this price...drove well in 10 minute test drive but wearing on my sense of value now after 7 months.  Many missing features previously mentioned by other reviewers. Gas mileage is well below advertised range. Toyota should be embarassed to charge this much for this vehicle.,
2007,21-04-2007,2,0.7351,2.5, I did a lot of resaearch and was awed by the reliability ratings of this vehicle and the reputation.  I bought it based on these attributes but now I feel like I left a lot on the table in terms of style and features compaed to other similar vehicles.   Some specifics that I miss in this suv versus my last one (and others I consdiered):  -No Dual climate control -No Heated rear seats -Unattractive exterior styling -Handles poorly...lots of sway -Sound system poor especially when driving with windows open -No rain sense wipers -Big and bulky...not precise -A lot of plastic trim -No in dash cd changer -no auto dimming outside rear view mirrors ,

2010,08-07-2010,3,0.4019,4.75," Can't tell you how Toyota measures cargo space but they must not use the standard formula of W x L x H. The stated 95.4 cu in is grossly overstated: Measuring w/ back seats down from the tailgate to back of front seats from the roof to the floor (top of lowered seats) and from the widest width I come up with 70"" x 34"" x 42"". Totaling 99960 cu in. Divided by 1728 cu. in. that make a cubic foot I come up with 57.8 cu ft. If the driver and passenger are cargo that might make the difference. Measuring the same area on the Honda Pilot I come up with 74 cu ft plus about 1 1/2 feet under the back mat. And the seats all lay flat. Unlike the Highlander.",
2010,26-08-2010,3,0.8121,3.375,wish they had V4 in upgrades Not just base. needs to come with Blue Tooth and some other extras      ,
2010,20-09-2010,3,0.9695,4.75, Haven't had this car to long but I've been with Toyota for many many years. The highlander is just about everything you could need in a SUV. Lot of room good gas mileage at least the V4 is. Great car with out paying $40000.00. Can't get much better then this one for SUV. We put in a blue tooth it did not come with that.,
2010,26-09-2013,3,0.9199,4.875, I really enjoy my 2010 Toyota Highlander Limited. This vehicle definitely has a great amount of power along with a smooth and quite ride. I have previously owned some of Lexus's high end SUV's and I must say I don't see much of a difference in the ride quality features style etc. Granted I did purchase the limited so the features are much improved over the base model. The only thing I can say negative about the highlander is fuel economy. I get around 16 mpg with a good mix of highway and city driving. I understand that is not awful for a midsize to somewhat larger SUV but I just don't like that,
2010,16-11-2009,4,0.6087,5,they state its 20 city & 27 highway. That being said BUY THIS VEHICLE!,

2010,28-11-2010,4,0.6808,5, I would like to say that this is our first leather vehicle. Just as nice as our traded cloth Nissan. Highly impressive cockpit road visibility and totally quiet ride. My children love the DVD player an added bonus no doubt. Rear reclining seats are a must. The whole no-key thing takes some getting used to. It's like the VISA of SUV's. Toyota has offered a level of refinement related closely to a lux cousin. You won't find another with more room comfort style or versatility. A clear choice from any vehicle in its price range. You can't go wrong with this one.  ,
2012,26-03-2012,1,0.1779,4.75, I just put 500 miles on my Prius C Three. I traded my 2010 Toyota Matrix for it. I'm glad to report I'm getting exact EPA mileage and then some.,
2012,09-02-2013,1,0.4588,4.5,No regrets! This subcompact is not for racing. You want to race get something else. I have no problems merging in freeway traffic and its size and excellent steering allow me to maneuver in city traffic easily. The seats offer plenty of support and adjust in enough positions to allow me to drive comfortably. The AC cools the interior quickly and I live in South Texas where the daytime temperature is already at 90 degrees. This model is very well equipped for the price. This is an excellent little car that does everything its supposed to do well.,
2012,03-04-2012,2,0.4215,4.75,The gas saving readings on each trip. The technology TOYOTA used to built these cars is really amazing. The sporty look that gleams along the highway everywhere I go with it.,

2012,14-09-2012,3,0.8126,4.625,Our 2002 Prius feels more solid with more power.,
2012,22-09-2012,3,0.5719,5,We live in West Va with hills everywhere.,
2012,26-09-2012,3,0,4.625,One Friday afternoon I was going home traveling North on the 5 FWY merging onto the 14 to Palmdale when on my left side observed a white Prius C speeding his way on the carpool lane going baldly about 80 miles per hour and said to myself all those comments about how fast these cars move on the FWY were just opinions not based on facts.That very same weekend went for mine and I am satisfied with the deal I got from Hamer Toyota at Mission Hills.,
2012,02-07-2013,3,-0.7096,5,In comparison to the Ford Fiesta and Focus the seats on the Prius C are heavenly! The ceiling of the interior cabin is comfortable for someone 6' tall. Beneath the armrest is a compartment but if you look at the bottom of it you'll see a notch to open up an even smaller compartment where you can stash something. The valet key is also nice because it prevents them from being able to open up the dashboard storage. Definitely read the manual cover to cover to get the best use out of all the little hidden features. Windshield wipers on the back window is also a huge plus. I don't bottom out over speed bumps and the tires are good on bumpy/potholed streets.,
2012,13-07-2013,3,0.9804,5,I wish there was an option for heated seats on all models and not just the Prius C model 4. I don't want all the fancy stuff on the 4 except the heated seats because it is cold in the mornings in Seattle 9 months out of the year. Maybe I missed it in the manual but having a simple default screen displaying the outside temperature and the direction (N W S E) you are driving would be nice. ,
2012,20-10-2012,4,0,3.5, Our PC2 is our second Prius.,
2012,21-10-2012,4,0,4.75, Between a Prius C and a MINI I ended up choosing the Prius mainly because of the fuel economy reliability and cost. My other commuter car is a 1990 Honda Civic DX also a small hatchbach and my second commuter car for the household. Surprisingly the Prius C engine is much louder when driving on the freeway in comparison to my 1990 Honda! You can tell the engine is working hard on the Prius to speed up but you can still pass cars easily on the freeway if needed. The interior is spacious and there is a nearly-hidden cup holder on the plastic compartment thing on the passenger door! I've never driven with a back-up cam and have no problems with the Prius C.,
2012,06-12-2012,4,0.5912,4, Every day is a pleasure with this car.,
2012,17-12-2012,4,0,5,I like the 2002 more even though the PC2's improved technology is nice.,
2012,28-11-2014,4,0.2247,2.625,Its MPG improved to the mid-40s when Toyota replaced the hybrid battery at no cost.,

2013,24-03-2016,1,0.6696,3, The first only reason to buy this car is for the 48 mpg you will get in all around driving. That's a powerful reason but the only one I can find to own this otherwise bland car.,
2013,02-06-2013,2,0.4215,4.75, I love my C! It is nimble well-made and fun to drive. Plus unlike so many other hybrids the mileage is no hype. I average 50 mpg and I've owned my car for about 4 months now. You go so long between fill ups that you almost forget about getting gas. Regarding the comments about acceleration it's no Ferrari but I've found it to be fine on on ramps and here in Philly that's no joke. Also many of the comparable hybrids sacrificed reliability. I don't think I should have to choose between great mileage and being stuck by the side of the road.,
2013,14-04-2014,2,0.836,4.875,  Update at 190000 miles.....4th set of tires installed last month. Replaced 12 volt battery as a maintenance thing. May change belts and hoses next month. Remarkably well running economical vehicle.,
2013,02-06-2014,2,0,4, I have owned my PC2 for 6 months now and have put just over 7k on it.,
2013,05-06-2015,2,0.7389,4.375, I was a Prius sedan owner for 10+ years and was waiting for an AWD version (still waiting).  A few nonessential systems started to fail that would have been $1500+ to replace and there was this adorable little C on the lot with 19000 miles on it.  The interior feels a little plasticky compared to the full-size but it has a better sound system and a fun sporty ride.  I'd compare it to that of a Mini Cooper: low-riding road-hugging but getting an average of 49mpg with a fair amount of highway driving.  The price was great and I like the car more every day.,
2013,09-04-2016,2,0,4,"Better mileage readout and analysis. It's hard to work the screen readout and the radio it's unintuitive and clumsy. You need an upgraded system to get some of the data. The manual also says nothing about how the ""scores"" are calculated and is unhelpful.",
2013,24-04-2016,2,0.2263,5, The Prius C is a small car but for a single driver who is commuting and occasionally carrying boxy items it can be a perfect fit. After 2-1/2 years I've had no major issues or mechanical problems with my car. It goes in for oil changes and once to have a remote release adjusted. That's the total maintenance and mechanical problems I've had. Others have said the car is noisy. If you floor it off a traffic light yes. In ordinary driving you can easily hold a normal voice level conversation with the people in the back seat.,
2013,21-05-2016,2,0,4,Higher-quality materials for the dash and steering wheel maybe a little more pickup at acceleration (but it's really not bad).,
2013,31-05-2016,2,0.3384,5, This is my first car purchase and I love it for a first-time car owner!,
2013,18-09-2013,3,0.8355,4.75,I picked the C and am very happy with the choice.,
2013,16-07-2016,3,0,4,I purchased it to be my commuter vehicle. I wanted something simple reliable and efficient. The PC is all of that.,
2013,21-08-2016,3,0.2263,5, I brought my 2013 Prius new in late December of 2013.  I've drove it for about 32 months and have about 47000 miles on it. The Prius C still runs great and I get well over 40 MPG and I don't drive 'slow'.  For me this is a Utilitarian vehicle and I am very satisfied. If you are trying to 'keep up with Joneses' you might want to look elsewhere. Sure it is kinda slow taking off but logic tells me to expect the Prius C to accelerate slow because I expect it to be efficient. I am big dude and there is plenty of room upfront for the driver and passenger when you slide the seats back.  It feels slightly bigger than my extended cab Ford Ranger.  I have even had 5 full size adults in the car. However with big people up front there is less room in the back because it is a small car.  The interior looks nice but I'm not a very materialist person. I've driven this car on many long trips: 5 hours 9 hours 8 hours each way. I've driven down a few bumpy dirt roads.  It rides fine from my prospective but I really don't care about the 'ride'. I'm a pretty 'tough' person; so the ride of a vehicle hardly impacts me. I've had plenty of used cars that ride terrible so in comparison this is great. So far no break downs but I'll report back at 80K miles. My only complaint is that in the snow the traction control makes it very difficult to drive.  I suggest buying a set of rims with snow tires if you live in an area that get lots of snow. If you are seeking a Utilitarian means of transpiration and do not need to transport more than 2-3 large adult; this is the car for you.,
2013,02-11-2013,4,0.6115,4.75,Gas mileage handling quality size interior room and design.,
2013,23-12-2015,4,0.3612,5," Most people see the C as a downgraded Prius. I see it as the ultimate Econo-box. Even in the basic trim (One) this car has built in bluetooth turn signal indicators on the side mirrors mp3/usb a digital speedometer and that 4"" color screen chock full of information. Best part? 49-50mpg with A/C blasting in the summer and the heater blasting in the winter while driving it like a regular car (from stop & go to FWY speeds). Feels about the same as my previous car a manual transmission Yaris Hatchback with a way more modern / techy feel and design. Price-wise the cheapest C is comparable to the highest trims of the Yaris or Fit. Looking @ newspapers I've seen the One advertised for ~$17k.",
2013,28-12-2015,4,0.6888,5, People shy away from the Prius C because they like the bigger normal Prius better. But you save almost $10k on the C brand new! It really does get 48-50 mpg combined street/highway driving for us. It has great acceleration for such awesome gas mileage. The engine doesn't whine and scream like many cars in its class. This car is a joy to drive. It has the reliability you would expect from a Toyota (awesome!). And it holds more than we'd expect both in passengers and cargo. Our only disappointment so far is the low resale value after just a few years. We'll just keep it gladly.,
2013,23-10-2016,4,0.6124,5," I'm embarrassed that I love this little car this much! I'm an Environmental Science teacher and I hope I live an eco-conscious lifestyle but having a family has meant driving a larger car (a Camry) for years. I bought this to replace an ancient Corolla and handed the Camry down to the teenagers. Driving it is like playing a video game. Your high score is your mileage and you adjust your acceleration and steady speed to take advantage of the electric motor and accommodate traffic. As for the interior I have long legs and driver's side leg room is a little less than I'd like or I'd like the steering wheel to extend a little more than it does. I've put the teenagers in the back seat for short (30 min) rides and they are fine. The hatch is small but I wasn't looking for huge quantities of hauling storage and the rear seats do have a split fold-down. I found it in ""habanero"" which is really orange and I love having the most cheerful car in the parking lot :-) And consistently getting over 50 mpg is so much fun! Once I got up to 76.1 mpg!",
2013,01-11-2016,4,0.9561,5, If you are looking for a super-cool one of a kind yuppie worship vehicle don't buy this. If you are looking for super dependable safe reliable economical transportation buy this. My purchase was made strictly because my new business required these features not extra cup holders and lots of chrome features. In the two and a half years of ownership I have driven 160000 miles and the car still runs like new. Maintenance has been synthetic oil/filter change every 5000 miles. Transmission fluid changed at 50000 miles tires every 55000 miles. Tuneup at 100000 miles and brakes rotor replacement at 135000 miles. I was forced to drive over a wooden pallet at 70 mph on the interstate because I couldn't change lanes . Bent front steering arms and in a couple of hours back on the road. Didn't even have a flat tire but could have used fresh underwear.,
2013,28-11-2016,4,0.9762,5, The car is just perfect as a 3rd car.  I have an A5 and a Volvo S60 Cross Country and the Prius C 4 is still a hoot and a blast to drive.  I call it my little truck with hatch and use it for home depot Walmart Target etc for big shopping I can review stock market my wife shops with the entune system we check the weather listen to satellite radio cruise set at 70 on parkway with Climate control on and heated seats whilst never taking hands off wheel. and our navigation system is finding the way while we enjoy the scenery.  I can only recommend the 4 level the 15 inch wheels and the optional interior weather tech floor mats.  I also recommend the hatch floor mat tinting the windows and rear bumper guard.  I drive the car from NY to Pittsburgh all the time and gas costs me about 26.00 dollars each way incredible.  Never had an issue with the car did replace the brakes and tires within 27K and wipers but I average 48.7 MPH for the life of Car.  Mileage goes down 8 MPG in winter with winter fuel.  Plus people love it some call it clown car but cant believe how roomy the interior is and the technology it has.  My favorite feature is MPG Heated Seats Entune System Touch Screen Graphics Steering wheel controls cargo capacity and bullet proof reliability.  My least favorite feature is the Faux Leather and the headlight system is not bright enough which I have upgraded especially for winter weather driving in pittsburgh.,
2014,26-02-2015,1,0,3.25,As for the car itself I find the seats to be very comfortable the build materials are fine after all it is an inexpensive car.  The 3 level has some cool features like push button start doors unlock when they detect the key and touch screen with navigation.,
2014,19-05-2016,2,0.7906,4, They should have talked to me first.  This was a rushed purchase and I very well might still have bought it.  I had been a devoted Nissan Sentra owner since the Datsun B-210.  Kept them all over 10 years.  But then you get to that point where needed repair expenses could be invested in a new car...in this last case I had a broken spring a surprise so it wasn't safe to drive.  The pressure was on.  The new Sentra was way too big for my comfort and fitting in the garage with a Chevy...and I hated the console between the two front seats.  My sister had the Prius C...so I wound up at a Toyota  dealership I should have walked away from.  It was a terrible lesson learned the hard way...But back to the car....It was a good fit with a comfortable seat...and it was...okay...cute.  ANd there were colors beyond silver and black...The finish of the dash does look like one review noted as if there are scratches...which I guess is good because when my protective pup jumped up or a clip board slid down both leaving marks...it's less obvious.  Never happened in the Sentra...so I think they could do better about that.  The little pen section on the dash is a pain...it holds dust and crumbs and is a pain to clean.  I like closed concealed space.  The cupholders are in a great position...up front and center on below the dash...but they were not smart enough to make a liner that could be removed to be washed.  I also dislike the placement of the other driving mode buttons beneath the handbrake.  If my pup is with me she can easily stand on that.  I was able to get a strong small container that was shallow enough to place over the buttons and then put a folded towel over that.  Problem solved...  It also was a big transition to go from a trunk to a condensed space in back.  In thinking about getting a new piece of luggage I had to measure carefully to make sure it would fit to be concealed.  So I guess it's true that it is more a city car and not one for a road trip with more adults who have baggage unless it's short trips with limited bags.    I also woke up in a sweat after starting the sales process when I realized that my pup who can be protective and even if not...could squeeze her way through over the back seat and out the hatch if she were determined.  A real scare factor for me.  As a precaution I both have her secured via seat belt loop and also got one of those metal barriers which I put behind the back seat.  And of course...you've gotta love the gas mileage.  That is a relief.  Going totally electric would just be too nerve wracking for a single woman driving alone...,

2014,18-09-2014,3,0.046,4.5, I got the Pricus C 3 for 1 reason the advertised MPG.  I have an 80 mile round trip commute that consist of 85% highway driving and was tired of filling my SUV up every 3 days for $55+ each time.  I now average 64MPG each way and fill up every 6 days for $25.  I'm totally blowed away with the amount of money I'm saving.  There are loads of YouTube videos that show how to drive a Prius I highly recommend them if you do buy a Prius.,
2014,28-07-2016,3,0.9815,5, I've only had the car less than 1 month but so far it is everything I had hoped it would be.  It's my commuter car / kid shuttle.  It handles great on city streets and has a surprising amount of pickup.  Hope we have a long future together.,

2014,20-12-2016,4,0.9481,5, Very good car. Excellent workmanship everything is tight with no rattles (as with Detroit products). Not a speedster but you get use to not pulling in front of people. This was my first Japanese car. I have had many Detroit specials but no longer.,

2015,22-04-2015,2,0,2.5, Unfortunately I cannot recommend this car. Although it does get great mileage it doesn't perform at the advertised MPG on the highways. I typically average between 38-42 MPG and drive no faster than 70 MPH. When in traffic or the city the car's MPG really shine.,
2015,16-04-2016,2,0,5,We test-drove the Three and then quickly realize the features that would be missing on the One. The price difference was about $2k and being the 4th of July weekend and all other incentives we went for it. We still bought it cheaper than buying just the One on a regular day. Thanks Toyota!,

2015,08-10-2015,4,0.9585,5, I got my silver Prius c One about 3 months ago and I am absolutely loving this car!!! Since most of my driving is in the city I'm averaging a ridiculous 57 MPG without doing anything special. I also love the look and feel of the interior - feels very premium for an entry-level car. The light gray seats (only available on the One) are super soft and comfortable (so much better than all non-leather seats on other cars). The color combination of the seats and dashboard/head unit looks amazing with the silver exterior color. There is also a surprising amount of space inside - way more than you would think looking at the car's exterior. I'm also very pleased that Toyota added a touch screen softer interior materials and LED headlights & taillights all standard for the 2015 model - they really give the car a premium feel. Combine this with an incredible price of $18500 ON THE ROAD free 2 year maintenance rock-solid Prius reliability with a tried-and-true hybrid system - and you have a car that's very hard to beat. The only reason I wouldn't recommend this car is if you do ALL of your driving on the highway - you'd be better off with a Corolla or Mazda3 for the same price. But even if you do mixed city/highway this car is still fine - I have no problem getting this car up to 80-85 MPH (slightly more road/wind noise than Corolla/Mazda3). And if you do mostly city like me the Prius c is the halo car for congested stop-and-go traffic areas like mine - not only for fuel efficiency but more importantly for pollution (which can be 10 times less compared to other cars in these conditions). The bottom line: I could not have wanted a better car than my 2015 silver Prius c One :),
2015,14-10-2015,4,0.3818,4,,
2015,25-10-2015,4,0.995,5, I have previously driven Honda Fits (07 and 2012) but I didn't care for the new redesign. I never really considered the Prius (was leaning more towards a Crz or Golf) but that was before I saw the c at a dealership one night. It was shining in the moonlight and looked so edgy- futuristic. I test drove it the next day and it was mine within the week! I REALLY ENJOY my c. It hugs the road through messy weather and brakes nicely. The interior is very stylish-blue instrumentation and a touchscreen light the front. The c is so quiet. One foggy night we left the movies and before we hit highway speeds it felt surreal - silently cutting through the fog the futuristic interior/blue glow and high powered LED lights- so memorable. The fuel economy is excellent! The acceleration takes some time getting used to but now I know how it handles- its not peppy like a Fit but it isn't a sluggard either. Because it is a Hybrid it is not a powerhouse but I never feel intimidated merging or traveling on the interstate as the engine does have a little kick when needed! The c holds quite a bit too-flatten the rear seats in any combo and it almost gives the Fit a run for its money in storage space. I do wish it had more hidey-holes and cup holders like the Fit though. I truly feel blessed to have and drive such an amazing little car. Respect the Prius!,
2015,01-11-2015,4,0.6588,5, The best words I can say about this car is AMAZING SAFTY!!! If for no other reason you could find the safety of thus car should be the ,1 reason to buy it. Not only is it beautiful  gas savings  roomy (for a small car) it also has great safety).  My son got a 2012 modle. The other day him and 3 passengers were in a wreak. The air bags came out from the front at all doors the back seats and the trunk. Thank God because all though the engine was all over the road from where it drops down for safety  NO ONE was badly hurt. All the pain was coming from the seat belts that kept them from bouncing around. I am so greatful that my son got this car and we will be getting another one. I wish there was a bigger way to express my graditude for the people who have worked hard for making this car safe. It's worth the price to buy this car.
2015,10-11-2015,4,-0.3629,5, I leased a 2012 Prius C Two and when the lease was up debated buying it but given it was November I negotiated a deal on a 2015. The three years with the 2012 were trouble free but the 2015 upgrades are noticeable. The most practical improvement is the headlights which now project a good distance ahead. Aesthetic improvements include new vents a vastly improved climate control interface and updated taillights. The Three includes Toyota's E-tune system which is a mixed bag. The voice recognition can be quite frustrating and the navigation has little going for it verses Google maps on my phone. The Bluetooth interface however is seamless and using apps like Pandora is great on long trips. Consistent across the years is the excellent fuel economy and trouble free motoring.,
2015,14-11-2015,4,-0.1556,4,,
2015,18-11-2015,4,0,5,The car has trouble going faster than 80 mph but I don't really want to be driving any faster than that (I have a lead foot/self-control issue).,
2015,29-11-2015,4,0.9853,4," Upgraded interior from the year before definitely was a plus. Navigation and push start is standard at Three trim and above. LED headlights and tail lights are standard on all Prius C's. The car has a smaller engine than the regular liftback but at the same time more efficient on gas. Easy to park being about 155"" long. We did a lot of research on compact cars before settling on this one a close second was the Versa Note and the third car the Honda Fit.",
2015,05-12-2015,4,0.9044,5, While for some the Prius v with reclining rear seats is a must and still others inclined to jump into the Prius liftback (the Prius that started it all) I have to emphasize the amazing parkability of the Prius c!  I was given a Prius c for a day by the dealership and at the time decided the car was too small for the long term.  A month later my roomate got the Prius c and for the last two years I've had the pleasure of test driving it on weekends.  Living in Los Angeles it is extremely satisfying to be able to fit into parking spaces that you wouldn't even attempt with other cars relative to the size of the worlds best selling car also built by Toyota.  That one space that is truly just big enough for a compact car that is between a cement pillar on one side and a large truck parked at an angle over the dividing line on the other side the only space available in the lot because nobody else could fit in one so small and compromised.. Pull in with pride in your Prius c!  Sometimes this is the difference between making your appointment on time and circling up or down level after level in a parking structure.  The interior is spacious and comfortable and it drives with a wonderful center of gravity giving it the feel of a much heavier car.  There's also the fact that the Prius c is the highest mileage non plug-in hybrid car available.  I've averaged as high as 92.4 miles per gallon going from point A to point B 'from trip start.'  Otherwise nothing short of 50 MPG driving normally and even with a heavy pedal to merge onto the freeway.  It has a surprising amount of pep for it's size an if you step down hard on the pedal the car definitely holds its own.  I've wanted a Prius for a long time am the last one in my circle of friends and family to get one and am happier with the car than I imagined I would be.  Passing fuel stations for weeks at a time and filling a nine gallon tank when I visit one is more exciting to me now than the sound of a racing car engine used to be.  If you don't know the awesome definition of SULEV may I suggest you look it up or better yet call a Toyota store and ask.  It is the best reason to get this car!  If I could change one thing about the car it would be built in America like many other Toyota vehicles.,
2015,28-12-2015,4,-0.802,5, Gettin older and I needed a car with value and the least maintenance short of an EV while maintaining my 2 teen's NON hybrid older vehicles.  This is it. Bought it because of the best CVT in the business and the expected reliability.  I've not been disappointed. After 3 years the only thing I have done is changed the oil at 10K intervals the cvt fluid and plugs at 100K. Shocks and struts are next. The plugs were still in good shape but recommend dealer because it is not easy for most people. I know we will get 300K and beyond out of this vehicle on the original batteries alone. Mileage has only slipped 1 mpg in 3 years which is normal for any vehicle with this mileage already.   My new Altima has already had problems and been in the shop twice for premature rust.  Yup new car.  Will likely never buy another Nissan as their CVT still has issues.   Can't wait to get the larger prius hatchback after the kids leave the nest.  There is a reason these cars are preferred by Taxi companies.  Less maintenance best value currently.  These cars are the best bridge until EV's can go 200+ miles per charge and are cost competitive.,
2016,05-01-2016,1,0.5707,5,Engine:  (in my opinion) - this is a truck with a large but factory choked V6.  Toyota probably keeps it detuned for long lasting and reliable reasons!  I'm certain this rig is easily capable of 325+ HP if tuned.   ,
2016,04-03-2016,1,-0.3626,5,- The driver seat needs some lower lumbar support at least for my back. My Jeep has an adjustment on the seat that does that; this car does not.  ,
2016,11-03-2016,1,0.7579,5, When I bought my 2009 Prius I was very pleased with the car and the gas mileage.  However I was disappointed I had to give up certain creature features that I had in my 2005 Prius.   However my 2016 Prius exceeds my expectations as compared to my 2005 Camry.  I have the moonroof I gave up with my 2009 Prius.  However I now have all of the features I use to have with my Camry.  All of the electronic safety are fantastic.  It has an excellent ride and is very quiet on the road.,
2016,27-03-2016,1,0.6249,3, The slightest crosswind or crown in the road sends the car left and right. It could be in part due to the heavy battery ballast under the seats. Or maybe it was just designed wrong. ,
2016,06-01-2017,1,-0.5106,5, I got this to be a commuter car.  It's perfect for that in my opinion.  The gas mileage is through the roof.  After 25000 miles I average 52 mpg overall and higher under certain circumstances.  It's not the quietest car but it's a lot quieter than my minivan.  It's comfortable.  The controls are easy and logical.  The built-in USB support is really nice.  Cargo space is tight if you have the back seats up but great if you fold them down.  I really really enjoy just tooling along in this car.,
2016,11-01-2017,1,0.9858,5, The Prius C is built to save gas.  Acceleration is slow even if you try and and gun it.  It is adequate enough to speed up more than the average car in normal driving.  In freeway entrance with two lanes I'm more than 90% faster than other cars I assume driving normally and not racing me.  The battery charging without the plug in but by the combustion engine is adequate to lower MPG by assisting in acceleration and taking over the stop and go without turning the gas engine on.  I've heard people complaining about the braking system.  It doesn't take long to get used to it and enjoy the regenerative braking and see the animation of your batteries being charged.  If you are childlike in terms of personality you'll probably hate and throw a tantrum so don't buy it.  For the thinking person it's quite a joy to see how efficient the Prius C is.  I see it more appealing to people who eat healthy and understand the importance of quality living and not the junk food crowd who are more into satisfying their hunger and feelings.  The CVT continuous variable transmission is awesome. It's actually more efficient and quicker than the regular planetary automatic or manual transmission.  The CVT does not have a pause power is constantly applied making it quicker.  I heard that CVT was rejected by dumb consumers on regular cars because they wanted the feel of the inefficient of gear shifting.  CVT was acutally conceptualized by Leonardo DaVinci in 1490 and was first patented in 1829 for a saw mill.  First cat to patent is Daimler Benz in 1886.  I got the Prius C one the most basic for me the car is not for luxury or sport use it's a way to save money.  I got 2 Mercedes a Ram Hemi a BMW Z4 and Mini Cooper S for the fun sport and luxury part of driving.  For my cheap side my family drives the technologically advance and energy efficient Prius C.  You can't help but love it.,
2016,31-01-2017,1,0.951,5, Do your homework and use all the internet assistance. I was all prepared when I arrived at the dealer and had a pleasant experience.,
2016,13-02-2017,1,0.9348,5, I live in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania more so east of Pittsburgh I originally had a 2002 Toyota camry with a V6 engine. It had 200k on it and it was 15 years old the transmission was starting to slip and I decided that it was time for an SUV as my camry got me through college and grad school for me. I wanted an SUV that was on a Frame.  Everything is gearing towards cross over and AWD which I did not want.  Ive been searching for over a year trying to find a used 4runner that would be a great deal.  Everything that I saw wasn't worth it buying used.  These do not depreciate they hold there value hence why I decided to purchase a new one instead of a used one.  I have always wanted a 4runner and I found the trail premium has a lot more features to go off roading which I felt like this was the best value if I ever decide to sell it would hold is value more than the lower model 4runners.  I got white because it holds its value better and it is easier to keep clean.,
2016,22-02-2017,1,0.9822,5, Great car and reliable for city driving!!!!,
2016,07-03-2017,1,0.6369,4," My husband and I are both 70.  We are conservative very conservative and the idea of buying a high-mpg car usually drives our car searching.  We were pretty sure we were going to go with a Prius and we narrowed it down to a Prius C Four or a Prius Three Touring.  We wanted the amenities of leather seats and a navigation system.   We were tired of allowing time to get lost every time we were going to a new location.  We drove a Prius C Four first - it was bright yellow which was probably not age-appropriate but we liked it except for one thing . . . the way the engine groaned when you needed it to climb a hill.  We loved the car more than we had expected.  Then we drove the Prius Three Touring and there wasn't anything about it we didn't like.  The price difference between the two cars was about $4000.  We were trying to drag out the shopping timeframe to guard against an impulse buying.  Our sales person told us about his Prius Four Touring that he had just traded in the day before.  It wasn't ready to test drive but we looked at it and noticed it had the blind spot detectors.  It was 3 months old and had less than 4000 miles on it.  So the idea of that car was just hanging out on the ""back burner"" for a week or so.  Another dealer let us take either of the cars we were interested in over the weekend.  So we took a Prius C Three (they didn't have a four at that dealership) for the weekend.  So on Saturday we took the borrowed Prius C on an outting that took us to the dealership with the Yellow C Four and the Used Prius Four Touring.  We drove that yellow car again and still liked it.  Then asked to drive the used Prius Four Touring.  Our original salesman was off that day and they were busy so they let us drive the Four Touring without a salesperson in the car.  We hardly drove off the lot before we looked at each other with eyes of super approval.  When we got back to the dealership the substitute salesperson was nowhere to be found.  We waited about 20 minutes and then just left and took the borrowed Prius C back to the other dealership.  I emailed the original salesperson and told him we wanted his Four Touring.  And two days later we took it home.  It still growls a little going up hills from a cold start but not as much as the C did.  In the end it was the extra safety features that sold us on the car . . . afterall we're not as mentally sharp as we once were.  :-(",
2016,18-04-2016,2,0.1793,5, I ended up with a Prius due to a strong strong recommendation from a family member who swears by them.  I took a data-driven approach to justifying the purchase showing that the Prius is the car the minimizes lifetime cost for a set of safety reliability and size characteristics.  Here the Prius has lived up to my expectations.  So yes the Prius does often make sense for your brain.  However make sure that it's really the car that you actually want too.  A bunch of things beyond the numbers really bug me about it.  The outside is really ungainly and the inside's high contrast color scheme isn't my style.  The center speedometer I thought would be fine but when I hold my hand around 2 o'clock on the steering wheel my hand blocks it.  Without a doubt the Prius is an incredibly well engineered car but that's not all there is to a car purchase.  If I were doing it again I'd choose one of the many other cars that is also well engineered but looks and feels a bit more conventional.,
2016,25-04-2016,2,0.5195,4,Transmission:  The 5 speed is dated (albeit reliable as it approaches the end of the development cycle).   ,
2016,12-05-2016,2,0.0442,5, This car takes my breath away.  It is a luxury car that gets fantastic miles per gallon.   I couldn't ask for anything better.,
2016,13-05-2016,2,0.7405,4, I bought this car as a secondary commuting car to save massive amounts of gas money as I drive probably 70-80 miles a day during the week. I figured it would just be a means to get me from point A to B with four wheels a steering wheel and great gas mileage.,
2016,18-05-2016,2,-0.25,4,To me it's a truck with extra seating and storage.  The 4x4 including crawl locker and terrain select have been used quite extensively by this driver.  I've been in back country fresh snow (a few times now) mud and desert.   The factory Dunlop GrandTrek tires remain as the Achilles heel when playing in fresh deep snow or mud.  So far (knock-on-wood) the 4Runner has taken everything I've thrown at it.   Of course keep in mind being alone miles from nowhere I've had to keep a conservative approach to things! ,
2016,18-06-2016,2,0.9564,4, Never had a 4WD vehicle before but took my new ride to the nearby mountains to try it out. Got worried real quick on a few trails that put me at bad angles but the SUV handled them real well and improved my confidence fast. Worries of low gas mileage EPA rates at 18 already higher if I limit the 4WD. Last fill I got over 20mpg but my last car was a Prius which averaged nearly 50. I'm doing okay and expect to get better mileage as I go along. Have been driving Toyotas for 30 years and never had a bad one. At my first fill-up the guy behind me came up and said I'll enjoy the 4Runner he has over 300k miles on his with only two minor problems. I expect the same from mine.,
2016,07-07-2016,3,0,5, This 4th gen Prius is not the same car as older versions.  In the one month that I have had the car I continue to be surprised by the many preconceptions that have been proven wrong.  1) It accelerates well - step on the gas and the electric motor together with gas engine will pick up the speed very nicely.  I have not had to floor the accelerator yet when passing or merging onto freeway.  2) EPA gas mileage of 53 is wrong.  It is also wrong that highway MPG is lower than local.  I have been averging 63 combined and little difference between local and highway.  3) It handles very well thanks to the new 2016 rear suspension.  Coming from a BMW 3 series the handling is comparable around corners and turns.,
2016,10-08-2016,3,0.8074,4,I was pleasantly surprised even on the test drive but even more so after driving it daily for the past 5000 miles.,
2016,07-09-2016,3,0.0772,5, Absolutely love my new 4Runner. It is off the charts in terms of reliability durability and pure function; this truck can go anywhere and do anything. Don't let reviews about poor handling sway you - this handles accelerates and drives fantastic for the type of vehicle this is: a body on frame truck. For anyone looking for superb reliability great style and a vehicle that can go anywhere under any circumstance for 15+ years this is for you.,
2016,13-09-2016,3,0.3612,5,Let me start off with my complaints although they are somewhat trivial: ,
2016,13-11-2015,4,0.1511,5,Reason for purchase:  4x4 alone quite often and needed a reliable vehicle to get me into the middle of nowhere.  As an amateur astronomer I also needed room for dry/clean storage.  Also needed an interior long enough for sleep (I don't tent). ,
2016,24-12-2015,4,0.9734,5, Simple review: Buy one if you want to off-road more than the average bear!    ,
2016,03-10-2016,4,0.9061,3,Some minor disappointments.  Less internal storage in the car.  Lost the above glove compartment storage and storage area under the center console.   Also lost the limited storage area located over the spare tire.  Oh ya I got a model 4.  The problem is I no longer have a temp spare tire but a repair kit and inflator.  The is a [non-permissible content removed] moment when I realized that I paid more for a model 4 and didn't get a spare tire.  My salesman is trying to get me information on why.  We looked at a model 3 and it had the temp spare tire.   This may have been an engineer decision where because of the additional safety features in my model 4 they had to balance the overall weight of the vehicle by eliminating the temp spare tire.  Come on Toyota that is not right.   Positive on a recent 30 mile round trip I averaged 60 MPG with normal driving condition.  Love that!,
2016,06-10-2016,4,0.7126,5, 2016 Limited 4500 miles - my wife's truck...love everything except for a transmission noise. It is common to other 4runners as the dealer took us for a ride in a new limited with 0 miles and it also had the noise. It is a sort of tinny rattling sound coming from the transmission and for a tight truck like this you would not expect it. If not for that it would be great sort of surprised Toyota allows this. If it gets worse we will address it if not I expect we will live with the annoyance of the sound.,
2016,03-11-2016,4,0.128,4,- The forward view from the driver seat is great; however there are enormous blind spots on the side and the rear windshield is tiny. Makes changing lanes in Chicago traffic interesting to say the least.,
2016,19-11-2016,4,-0.4767,1,"I've verified the alignment twice and even scheduled a test drive with the service manager. He told me he didn't think there was anything wrong. Serves me right for thinking I was accompanied by an ""expert""! My 94 Corolla wagon with the bent tie-rod steers much better than this vehicle.",
2016,12-12-2016,4,-0.1154,5, Love It.  Second one now.  1st one was great as is this one so far.  Just wish they would offer a no carpet rubber mat option or at least easily removable carpets for those of us who use it as a SUV rather the soccer mom driving their kids to town and never getting off pavement.  Get a Highlander or mini van!  Owned various American corporations SUV's and trucks until got tired of sitting in the garage waiting on them to fix whatever broke next still under warranty!  I used the term Am. Corps rather than American SUV's as many are made out of this country and those assembled in the country often have mostly foreign parts so....The issues were often recurring ones and warranties end so guess who pays then.  Repairs seemed to start @ $500 and go way up from there!  Haven't had one issue since making the switch to Toyota and Honda 15 vehicles back.  Not one other than the gas pedal recall when someone was looking to make a fast buck due to their ignorance!  5 minute fix done at normal service appointment.  My wife and I EACH drive around 35000-40000 a year mostly for work so we don't have time to be sitting at the dealership waiting for them to patch issues resulting from shoddy design failures and/or poor workmanship.  Come trade in time the Toyota's and Honda's have consistently cost us $4000 to $6000 less in depreciation!  They hold their value if taken care of!  I imagine that is a result of the dependability vs. the American crap we used to drive.  My only complaint with the Toyota's and Honda's I have owned is that the tires that come with the base vehicles are junk.  Now I make them take the tires off immediately and put on Michelin's.  Secondly is the paint.  Total junk.  Scratches with weeds and even fingernails at the door handle!  GM used Dupont paints and clear coats and there is a world of difference.   I would rate the 4 Runners Highlanders and Pilots 10/10 if it weren't for those two glaring deficiencies.  While not perfect they are the best out there we and 12 of our family members have found.    While this one is relatively new my wife and I have driven slightly over 1 Million miles in Honda's and Toyotas.,
2017,03-01-2017,1,0.9833,5, The Corolla iM was compared to the Honda Civic LX and Mazda3 Sport.  It won the financial terms and was second for technical/performance. I valued safety (with front collision avoidance more important than the excellent Mazda Blind Spot Monitoring) controls and instrumentation (yes you can see the display in bright sunshine) and acceleration.  The Corolla iM was third in the last category but it's okay.  I really enjoyed my Mazda 3 with the 2.5L 184 hp but this vehicle would cost another $ 2 or $3 G.  Toyota only needs to drop a higher powered engine (such as the Scion tC that I had for seven years) and add blind spot monitoring.,
2017,08-01-2017,1,0.9488,5," Great interior layout.  Wonderful screen suite with lots of options on info to display.  Really like the 11"" screen with ability to have map on top half and something else on bottom with music title and artist along very bottom.  Speedometer in middle of dash works well and helps inside of vehicle seem even more roomy.  Driver cockpit is spacious and well designed (I'm a 6'2"" man with a few extra pounds on my frame).  Gas savings work like a charm.  Babying it I'm able to get a combined 58 mpg (based on real miles divided by gas put into tank and not just the trip computer which can suffer from 1/x issues for small x for even average trips ~40 miles where x is the gas consumed).  That 58 mpg was without plugging in to charge for full EV mode.  Plugging in is simple and running in full EV mode the car runs like a champ.  Just don't expect Camaro performance but who would ever think that way about a Prius Prime anyways? Overall range > on a single tank is wonderful especially since my work commute is 90 miles round trip -- I'm back to being able to fill up once a week instead of every fourth day.  Bought in Dec 2016.",
2017,11-01-2017,1,0.9884,3, Nice driving car.  Lower gears excellent fro stop and go traffic.  Can hang in second gear.  Very broad torque curve.  Can accelerate to freeway speeds in 3rd gear.  Top gear acceleration in 6th is impressive.  The engine turns 3000 rpm @ 75.  Very easy to hit triple digits.  Very quiet and composed on the freeway.  Suspension soaks up dips very stable - no wandering over uneven roadway.  Seats are comfy and the auto temp control is a real plus.  Surprising room in the boot.  I donated my old minivan but saved a large box fo storing things.  Fits in the back of the IM with space to spare.  People in the back seat like the center armrest.  This car is a great value we love to take on trips.,
2017,12-01-2017,1,0.9598,5, If you are into a green car this is almost a no brainer. With the tax deduction it is very competitive to the regular Prius but you get an EV vehicle of about 25 miles. The car drives much better then my 3nd generation hybrid which I really loved. It's a lot quieter. I like the futuristic styling realizing it's not for everybody. By the way electric really only make economical sense if you have a solar system. It sucks but gas is otherwise very competitive,
2017,19-01-2017,1,-0.1007,5,"My recommendation:  Buy this safe well-crafted car.  Then disable the pre-collision system and lane departure alert ""safety features"" before driving it off the dealership parking lot.",
2017,20-01-2017,1,0.997,5, I traded a 9 year old matrix on new IM cvt .If the IM is as reliable as the XR was then Ill be a happy camper. I did have to give up cargo capacity and towing capabilities so time will tell how much that'll be missed but made a huge gain in handling  comfortand fuel economy. Added bonus...auto insurance lower due to all the advanced safety features. Overall I am very satisfied with the value and contrary to some reviews I find the engine and transmission performance quiet and responsivereturning mpg's in the high 30's low 40's. Only complaint is the projector beam headlamps..very sharp cutoff and not a wide enough path.Will probably solve with driving/fog lamps at some point.,
2017,01-02-2017,1,0.8357,5,What I don't like was hardly a deal breaker - it doesn't come with Sirius but I just attached the kit and use the auxiliary port.  No CD but that is more common now in new cars as you can use a USB stick.  There is also some useless entertainment app installed but I use what I want and the sound quality is great for this sporty cute car.,
2017,13-02-2017,1,0.9787,5, So far my favorite generation. The seats are very comfortable. It achieves what you want it to do. Which is great gas mileage. I do recommend a 240 V charger. I got one  for less than $300 installed it myself and takes less than two hours to get a full charge of 22+ miles of electrical mode.   The lane departure assist is fairly weak. I wish it was more assisting in putting the car back in the middle of the road. You do you have to wash your car a lot to keep the sensors clean so they operate properly.   I do enjoy the adaptive cruise control. I drive a lot about 30000 miles a year. I also love the heated steering wheel even more than the heated seats.   I like the styling of the car. And the headlights are amazing at lighting up the road and giving you optimal visibility rain or shine.    The menu is a little bit confusing at first but you'll get the hang of it. It does give you lots of options on how to customize your settings etc. the big downside is the Chi charger it only works on Samsung phones. Not iPhones. I used to own a 2010 Prius. But This car is far more better looking.  The JBL stereo is just so so. Nothing fancy I thought it would be better. It does the job but I wouldn't mind a better upgrade.   I average 55 to 60 miles a gallon using hybrid mode. And I get 22 to 25 miles on electrical after I plug it in. One downside is driving fast. For example cruising at 75 mph or more I'll get about 47 miles per gallon.,
2017,21-02-2017,1,0.9412,4," Overall the Corolla iM is a great little car; once the pre-collision system and other misguided ""safety improvements"" are disabled.  The car alarms every time it rains.  Literally.  The car alarms then *cuts power to the engine* while merging on the freeway!  This inherently safe car has been made unsafe to drive because control of the vehicle is taken away from the driver at the worst possible times.",
2017,01-03-2017,1,0.9788,5, Bought in Rhode Island I drove it 1200 miles home; 21 hours sitting comfortable and listening to iPhone tunes; 55.7 MPG; one fuel stop at 600 miles; dynamic cruise control followed high-balling trucks and; the radar looking through the rain and fog of the Poconos at I-81 speeds. It automatically paired with my iPhone 5s. Once home the second tank ran 699 miles at 60 MPG. The second week 7 days and 301 miles EV with 2/3ds using 'free' chargers around town ~$2.50 out of pocket. In EV it scoots around traffic without a problem using MG1 and MG2 as if they were a single motor. At a light off the line it instantly silently shames the noise machines. Taken fast the suspension flattens 'speed bumps'. Great visibility it no longer feels like being in a foxhole and finally the outside review mirrors cover the lanes on both sides. It is the first Prius strangers have volunteered that 'it looks good.' Unlike the driving folklore around our Gen-1 and Gen-3 Prius the Prius Prime does everything without tricks. For example engine warm-up the bane of all Prius the Prime handles by running in EV while the engine gently warms up. Then a couple of minutes later the warmed engine is giving over 60 MPG in the city.,
2017,10-03-2017,1,0.962,2, I was excited to check out the Corolla I'm but immediately put off by the garish slash of misplaced design across the dash and the fact that there was no CD player. Some of us still like cd's and don't really want to be put into a position to have to buy some over priced  iphone just to enjoy a little music. Anyway what about books on cd for those long trips.  Not everyone wants to conform to your idea of the latest trend no need to fix what isn't broken.  See ya I'm off to by something else.,
2017,12-03-2017,1,0.568,3, I'm only 5ft 6 inches in height but I had to contort my head and neck entering and exiting my Scion IM.  Power was nothing great either. Moned and strained on hills.  Dashboard controls  were boring.  I kept the car only a year and a half then traded it for a 2017 Rave4 XLE.  I love this car.,
2017,13-03-2017,1,0.948,5, Small trunk.,
2017,23-03-2017,1,0.3612,3, First let me say I owned a 2013 Ford Escape SEL before buying this vehicle.  That being said my Escape had more options on it for the price point.  I have never owned a Toyota before and I found the appearance of the RAV4 inviting.  The 2017 RAV4's only offer a 4 cylinder engine the 2016's offered a 6 cylinder.  The SE comes with the ECO/Sport modes.  ECO I'm getting about 29mpg Sport mode close to the same although engine is more peppy in sport mode.  There is plenty of power for merging onto highways and for passing in my opinion.  Interior is quiet and road/engine noise into the cabin is minimal.  The SE's suspension is more stiff a little more rough than I'd like but ok.  Almost no vehicle lean going around corners electric steering feels fine also.  Stereo is great!  Cabin speakers more than adequate better than my Escape's.  The seats are not as comfortable as I would have expected a bit disappointing!  The headlights and tail lights have the LED trim which looks very nice.  Great visibility at night with just low beams on!  Back seat is spacious cargo area fine.  The only thing I wish I had is memory button for drivers seat and a power passenger seat.  Other than that it's a nice vehicle but I only have a little over 550 miles on it so far.,
2017,30-03-2017,1,0,5, I've had the car for 3 month. So far I love the car. I read the reviews by the pros and I think they have no idea what they are talking about. The acceleration on I-95 is great. The car is very comfortable. My gas economy is outstanding. Nothing appears cheap in the interior as I read in some of the reviews. I had a compact Chevrolet Sonic prior to this car. The Sonic had twice as much trunk space as this car. The only problem that I ran into is insurance. I'm 62 and a perfect driving record. With all the advanced safety features in this vehicle my insurance went up $166 a year. WHY!!! I thought it would go down. The only features that I added to the car was painted on pinstripes and tinted windows. I purchased the vehicle for $17100 (CVT).,
2017,01-04-2017,2,0.9602,5, A decent discount at Toyota led me to consider this along with others in the class (Fit Focus Cruze)... I'm very happy with my decision I'm just loving this car.   ,
2017,11-04-2017,2,0.6783,3, This is really a great car easy to drive and great on gas. The cabin is nice and the materials look and feel terrific for its class The ride is rather firm but never too harsh. The seats are fantastic!!! The power is more than enough for normal driving and I have never found the engine noise too loud. Transmission is silky smooth.,
2017,15-04-2017,2,-0.126,4, The toyota Yaris IA  is a nice  compact car.  I love the look adn style of it. As a mom I wish it was a little more room from the in between the the front and backseats and more space from the seats to the doors. Overall it's a nice ride indeed. I'm not used to it yet but the push start button is pretty cool and the camera comes on where you are backing up to see others around you.   I got this car at Riverview  Toyota in Mesa Az. I had a awesome gentlemen name Milo take me around to look at cars. He was also nice to entertain my little one while completing the paperwork. A great guy who knows how to get things done fast. Thanks Milo!!  I enjoyed this location as they have a play areas for the kids which is needed when you have to be there a few hours to get everything done.,
2017,16-04-2017,2,-0.9575,3, Wife and I test-drove the RAV-4.  We were satisfied with the ride quality and performance but both felt that the interior design felt very generic and bland compared to say... the Volkswagon Tiguan and the Honda CR-V.  Trunk space is adequate but the driver's seat felt cramped and back seats won't be very comfortable for full-size adults unless you have the physique of a female gymnist.   Nothing against Toyota because they make great vehicles and I own a Tundra which I will take to my grave but Toyota engineers didn't exactly hit a home run when they re-designed it.  It's more like a base hit.,
2017,20-04-2017,2,0.993,5, My 2007 Yaris sedan just rolled past 231000 miles without ever being in the shop for repairs and costs less than $15000 when I purchased it new..Regular Toyota Care maintenance is the key.  I still get 38-40 mpg and you can bet if it ever lays down and dies on me my next car will be a Yaris.,
2017,21-04-2017,2,-0.7077,4, very good fuel economy. Manual shifts different,
2017,03-05-2017,2,0.9661,5, First and foremost; this is a Toyota built by Mazda in Mexico. That's a plus for value performance pricing and design. The pros  are many and I'll list a few. The 6 speed manual transmission ranks with BMW for ease of shifting and overall responsiveness. The car handles as well or probably far better than any car in its class. Fuel economy is on the fringe of a hybrid. I get 32 to 35 in town and 44+ on the highway. You'll hear the car is sluggish on hills and while passing at high speeds. I can only believe comments like that are based on the automotive or not shifting at higher RPMs  (3200 to 3600). If you shift at lower RPMs the car does not receive adequate torque and may seem sluggish. It's not. The car's safety features are first in its class and one can expect a five star crash rating. It comes with a myriad of standard features; many you'll pay more for in other cars in its class. The information system is easy to use and provides you a wide range of necessary information and entertainment features. I could add many more pros but choose to provide you with a few cons. This is a four seater. The center back seat is virtually useless. The car's digital tachometer with its analogue design is small and hard to read in direct sunlight. This is a minor issue because with the manual transmission it's a necessity. In the center of the tach you'll see two numbers; the gear you're in and the gear Toyota suggests you should be in. The suggested gear must be based upon fuel economy not performance. It has you shifting into 6th gear at 47 MPH...absurd. In summary this is not a sub compact. It's the same size as the Civic. Making it a compact. I've owned several cars including numerous BMWs a Lexus and Jaguar. For $16500 to $20000 finding a better car especially with an exceptional 6 speed manual will be virtually impossible.,
2017,10-05-2017,2,0.9212,4, The Prius Prime Premium trim offers the best price point from the 3 trim options available for the Prime. As a plug in hybrid the Prime is eligible for a $1500 rebate from the state of California and up to $4502 in tax credits. A full electric charge consistently gives me over 30 miles of city driving. The hybrid system is also impressive and I have been able to get an average of 87 mpg on a 10 mile round trip in the city. Overall after 1600 miles driven the car is averaging 73mpg. The electric engine has a good pick up while the hybrid system is a lot more sluggish when starting from 0. The big touchscreen wireless charging and Bluetooth integration with your smartphone are other nice features. On the negative side the Prime only seats 4 passengers doesn't carry a spare tire but has a flat repair kit instead and has a reduced cargo space when compared to the regular Prius.,
2017,14-05-2017,2,0.9552,4," Have had this car about a month now. I use almost every day. At first I thought the low power and cvt would bother me but car is sp smooth I hardly notice it anymore. Power in ""sport"" mode is actually adequate for everyday driving. Mpg are where they should be. Handling is where this car exceeds. I take off ramps and corners pretty fast and this car does not back down. It hugs the road pretty well. I don't regret buying this car especially with the deal I got on it.",
2017,17-05-2017,2,0.7717,5,The car's performance continues to impress me. It isn't slow and if you have the manual and downshift when it makes sense it's not slow on hills or on highways.,
2017,19-05-2017,2,0.9707,5, The awesome smooth ride safety features and cargo space drew me to the car and the great gas mileage keeps me in it.  It is not a fast car tho it is quick enough for me. The price/ value is great.,
2017,19-05-2017,2,0.661,4, The dash if you have sunglasses on cannot be seen very well. Can't turn the panel lights up high enough to see speed. And I wear light tint. Had the car 2000 miles USB went out. I do not have a power lift for the back and my wife is not strong enough to close the door when open Get the power lift. LE only comes with black interior seats sit well but shows all the dirt. Headlights at night are not as bright as they should be even on high beam. Should of got the xle would have been worth the price. Don't invest in cargo cover the window tint is so dark you can't see inside anyway. The good is that it is a quiet good ride good gas mileage and you will feel safe in it and it is a Toyota.,
2017,21-05-2017,2,0.9468,4," This is the bomb and since this would be the third prius in our lifetime it's appropriate as having exp three other gens  or models to explain the differences  for instance prius c we had this model virtually a month after it showed up at dealer showrooms. City it is spectacular bar none but we ended up moving back to the midwest and in the interim  drive many freeway miles horrible highway ride noisy to the point of wanting to jump out and abandon shop! Next was the 3rd Gen boxey and bulkey super fuel economy but horrible line of sight then back to what we'd had long time back the virtuous 2nd gen  wow just a beast goes & goes.  Now here I've just test driven the pentulimate expression and design of what a super cargo friendly sedan style ride can be plus ""wow"" factor  60+mpg  all day long! Interior feels a bit sparse but sensible and oh so quiet highways beware no more noise mauling once I decide to break the bank again buy this slightly odd looking but yet gorgeous performer?!! Oh What Feeling!!",
2017,22-05-2017,2,0.6128,5, I have had the car for less than a week but so far my experience has been great-- I love the looks and functionality of the dashboard features and the performance on fuel efficiency has been fantastic.  I think that I have actually gotten more than 25 miles of range on the electric charge and have spent over 80% of my time in EV mode--  I have driven about 150 miles and the indicator on my gas tank range has gone down less than 30 miles!!,
2017,28-05-2017,2,0.2449,5, We've only had this a few days but it lives up to the hype. I love the advanced safety features such as lane control sonar and back-up camera. Infinitely adjustable driver's seat is great for long trips. The best part is the driving range for in town trips. We can plug it in overnight and generally use only the battery around town saving the hybrid engine for longer trips.,
2017,08-06-2017,2,0.3182,5, No complaints so far - riding the Prime in EV mode is a joy. I did have a minor parking lot collision and the cost for OEM parts were very high - luckily covered by insurance.,
2017,20-06-2017,2,0,5, I'm getting 32 miles on electric mode enough for my daily commute.  Poor cargo space can only seat 4,
2017,26-06-2017,2,-0.4767,5, Dude this car has soo much power its unbelievable(95 horsepower like holy crap). I always floor it in my baby because its so fast. I fly back into my seat every time I accelerate its crazy. I always take risks in this car. I turn when other people normally think it is too risky. I've almost totaled my car a few times but it was way worth it. And that blind spot monitoring is great and always tells me when I'm out of my lane. And that pedestrian detection has saved countless lives from my driving. I personally also like to floor it to its top speed of 84mph on the highway SO FAST. Overall I give this car a 10/10 and I highly recommend it.,
2017,28-06-2017,2,0.1904,5,Have now owned this car for seven months and am still impressed. A few positive updates. I have gotten 48 miles per gallon on the highway.,
2017,09-07-2017,3,0.8402,4," Both the driver's and passenger's seats kill our backs! I'm seriously considering selling it after only having for 2 months!!! If I can't find an after market solution ie new seats (I've already tried 2"" thick memory foam seat cushions for both seats-which don't help at all) I will be selling. I don't care that I'll lose money. I won't be able to live with the hip and back hurting as badly as they do!",
2017,27-11-2016,4,0.9836,5, I have been driving 2017 Model for a week. It looks great. It is fun to drive and good MPG between 50 to 70 miles per 1KG of hydrogen. On the downside hydrogen stations are still limited and only available in California. Hydrogen is also expensive though Toyota offers free hydrogen for three years. So the only option is lease.,
2017,03-12-2016,4,0.9847,4, Edmunds promise price and deal was honored at dealer.  Easy way to shop.,
2017,11-12-2016,4,0.8934,5, Have had the car for a week and am really surprised by the performance the ride and how quiet the interior is. Fueling was easy but if Toyota wasn't paying for the fuel it would have been $58 for 3.5kg of hydrogen. There is virtually no storage space except a small glove compartment and the door slots for bottles. The center console has the wireless phone charger which is handy but eliminates storage for a few things. But that not withstanding it is an outstanding and solidly built car.,
2017,11-12-2016,4,0.9922,5,"	The hybrid-competitive and in some cases hybrid-besting gas mileage is what moved me to pull the trigger on the iA.  The base 4 cylinder Camry might get into the low 30's mpg with conservative driving which as many reviewers have noted is subpar for today's fuel efficient sedans.  While the iA even before the engine was fully broken in was giving me an average of 40.5 mpg of mixed highway and city driving.  Cruising along at a highway speed between 55-65 mph the fuel mileage calculator shows a stable 50+ mpg well above the EPA rating of 42 mpg.  After I used up the first full tank of gas that came with the car when I bought it I reset my trip meter to see how many miles I would clock before having to fill up again.  The low fuel light did not come on until I had 450 miles showing on the trip meter.  I looked in the manual to see how many gallons are left in the tank when the low fuel indicator light comes on and it's about 2 gallons.  I tested that and went on for another 52 miles to get a total of 502.3 miles on the trip meter.  When I topped off the tank I noticed that I did not reach the 12 (11.9) gallon limit which means that I still had close to half a gallon of gas still left in the tank.  Mind you that I am getting this gas mileage in a regular gasoline 1.5 liter engine with zero assistance from any hybrid technology all the while running the AC intermittently and defrosters in December.  The reported gas mileage of the iA is legitimate and even easily exceeds the EPA ratings.  You will not be disappointed with the fuel economy.     I swear that for around $5000 less than a 2017 Camry LE I do not find the iA to be much if any noisier at all save for some light whistling coming in near the top of the driver side window sill at hwy speeds on a windy day.  Overall the iA is very nimble and even fun to drive safe gets unbelievable gas mileage without the price and worry over hybrid tech has handsome enough looks and is certainly comfortable for a single person or married couple with small children.",
2017,12-12-2016,4,0,5, After looking to replace VW TDI that's part of emissions lawsuit with a car that's truly eco-friendly I settled on the Mirai and leased one on Friday 12/9/16. The current lease deal of $349/month + tax required just shy of $5000 in total drive off which is entirely covered by the CA clean air rebate program which currently still has funds available for fiscal year 2016-2017. The $15000 card that Toyota includes with the lease to cover hydrogen refueling should be about twice as much as I'll ultimately spend (note that insurance costs more for the Mirai than my VW so some of the monthly fuel savings is eaten up by that). I don't want to pay cost for electricity/charging an EV at work and being able to get ~300 mile range by fueling in 5-10 minutes was a lot more appealing to me than going BEV route even if hydrogen fueling stations are fairly spare (although should get better in 2017). In terms of the actual driving experience it's a lot more fun to drive than a Prius or the new Prius Prime (which I had initially put down a $500 deposit). It accelerates quickly has a really nice interior and the exterior look has also grown on me. I think we can all take concrete actions to help limit climate change and supporting the development of fuel cell vehicles and infrastructure is one way to do that. A few days in this has been a cool and easy to operate car that's been fun to drive! Definitely recommended!!,
2017,19-12-2016,4,0.8292,4,Its my first CVT and I was wary about some reviews on performance which I cant relate to  the acceleration is more than adequate for me on highways and surface streets and the ride is incredibly smooth especially for the price of this car.  Ive already had to drive in snow rain and strong winds and it has handled the conditions very capably.  As others noted youll likely turn off the lane departure alert.  The display is intuitive though I wish they had a digital speed/mph display setting in the center one. Dont expect the fuel economy of a Prius but its fairly good  Ive gotten about 36 mpg.  First hatchback Ive had in a long time and LOVE the convenience of being able to carry big stuff without needing a big car!  I got the pop spring green color - more like yellow - and hope I love that color a long time because Id really like this to be my dependable little ride for years to come.,
2017,19-12-2016,4,0,5, If you sit inside of the more expensive Corolla or even a Camry and get a feel for their infotainment system and touchscreen interface and controls and then go inside of the iA and use its center control dial system and gorgeous upright 7-inch  display I dare say that you would heavily consider the iA over the Corolla and yes even the Camry.  It works so well and feels like it was intended for a Mercedes or BMW.  The control inputs show up FAST on the screen and that backup camera is incredibly sharp - I can make out individual blades of grass and pebbles of gravel.  Yes outward visibility on the iA is very good and with that 7-inch backup camera image quality parking is extremely easy.  No the perfectly positioned upright 7-inch screen does NOT get washed out by sun glare whatsoever.  Push-button start is a great feature for convenience and if you prefer the silence of not having keys jingle over bumps or swinging and scraping your steering column.  You have to pay for that by going up to the highest trim level in the Corolla and Camry models but EVERY iA comes with push button start as a standard feature.  As aforementioned the iA is really more Mazda than Toyota and when it comes to seat geometry and comfort this seat hands down is more comfortable than the power adjustable seat on a 2017 Toyota Camry LE and certainly the absolute torture device of a driver seat in the 2015 RAV4 that I had to trade in last year for its discomfort and my friend's 2016 Corolla which pushes your shoulders in and strains your head forward in a way similar to the RAV4.  Even though the Camry seat has power adjustable lumbar support it is placed too high towards the middle of my back and no matter how much I raise and lower the seat the lumbar support fails to give support where I need it.  Whereas the general shape and architecture of the iA seat is more comfortable even without a manually adjustable lumbar support feature and I have room to spread and rest my shoulders back.  Keep in mind that I have a touchy back after suffering a joint sprain at the L2 and L3 vertebrae several years ago.  However despite my back problem I still think that the iA seat provides better overall support compared to the stiffer flatter seats in the Camry.  It's also worth mentioning that you can actually rest your head back on the headrest at an upright angle and not feel like the headrest is pushing your head and neck forward like so many other vehicles do these days especially like the RAV4 and Corolla do.   I tested my perception of the seat comfort of both the iA and Camry by going on 100+ mile test drives over some terribly bumpy roads at highway and in-town speeds and still even after owning the car for 3 weeks now the iA is a very comfortable car.  Plus the thick waffle weave fabric on the Camry seats seems overdone and looks like it will trap dirt very easily and be difficult to (keep) clean.  ,
2017,25-12-2016,4,-0.6299,5, I have owned over a hundred vehicles and I have to say this vehicle has a lot of bang for the buck. I am impressed with the interior quality it is nicer than my RAV 4 hybrid.  I purchased the vehicle for $16800. You cannot touch other vehicles for the price. I have owned many Toyota products and you cannot beat the quality. I am very satisfied with the engine/transmission combo. I am not sure how the CVT performs but the manual is great with this engine. The ride is superb. It is a great looking vehicle and the spring green color is uplifting during these drab winter days. I love all the standard safety features that Toyota now includes with all their vehicles for 17. I tried out all the competition before buying  they were more expensive and quality or size was not to my liking. I am happy with the 1.8 in this vehicle  great performance with great economy. I would not want a bigger engine. I had the 2.4 in my TC and XB and the mileage could have been better. I look for good looks reliability economy resale value nice ride competent handling and safety and hatchback versatility this vehicle delivers.,
