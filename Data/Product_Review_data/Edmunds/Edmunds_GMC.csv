1991,27-10-2004,4,0.7964,3.5, It was a lease back had 116000km on it. At 240000km rebuilt auto tranny. It has 350000km on it now and I have to get the tranny fix. It has been to Oregon. I drove it to the mountains sledding for ten years and never missed a beat. Now I pull my fishing boat and take it hunting every year. Great truck!
1991,25-06-2005,2,0.7415,4.75,Solid 4X4 with the right tires
1991,27-06-2005,2,0,4.375, The enviornment is perfect as a guy that works outdoors for a living.-25c it was warm and cosy after a day framing houses on the Manitoba praries same when mid july when the temps. were +35c that air cond. cooled off just right. At work it worked and it is so pretty you could go to the theater in the evening and the fellas in caddys wished they were driving my GMC.
1991,18-03-2006,1,0.4005,4.125, No serious problems except the brakes which a lot of problems with the ABS and internal failures of the front brake hoses that failed internally.
1991,13-09-2007,3,0.3818,5,Better gas mileage. Stronger rear springs. Stronger bushings on the front end.
1991,29-03-2008,1,0.6124,4.875,Independant front suspension. Factory skid plates that protect everything (You should look under some of the brand new 4X4 trucks out there.).
1991,12-07-2008,3,0.8663,4.625, I used to drive this truck hard every day as a ranch truck. It has been the best performing 1/2 ton 4X4 I have ever owned. There is currently 340000 miles on the original 350 engine and it still passes CA smog tests with flying colors. The auto tranny has to be rebuilt every 100000mi. Have had electrical problems with lights and the heater controls. Other than that this is a nice truck for the year and money. 
1996,14-01-2003,1,0.9385,2.875,  I was very excited to purchase this 
1996,24-06-2004,2,0.1531,1.125, This is a typical GM product.  It 
1996,08-04-2005,2,0.5106,4.5,"Heavy duty brakes. Quieter engine when the A/C is on. A/C that cools the back quicker. Maybe a ""beep beep"" sound for when your backing up!"
1996,19-01-2007,1,0.7692,4.25,Space. High top. TV/VCP comfort of driving area being taller on the road than most vehicles.
1996,26-06-2007,2,0.9032,4.625,Great stereo sound. Fun to kick back and watch movies in the back. Lots of cigarette lighters for convenient electrical hookups. Easy to keep up the interior maintenance on too.
1996,02-11-2007,4,0.8834,4.625, I seem to have similar experiences to those reviews already written. Brakes need replacing a lot driver's side window works 75% of the time scraped up running boards while learning my boundaries and they don't do well in airport parking garages!  But my 6 kids Love this van! So much so that with 158000 miles we just purchased a new one! We are excited about spending 10+ more years with this one.
1996,12-11-2008,4,0,4.75, We have owned this vehicle for three years now and it has been great transportation. We had purchased it to make regular back and forth trips from Texas To California but wound up moving to Pennsylvania. It was a great ride in the cross country expeditions. We have used to haul machines lumber water purifiers and just plain traveling. We like the capacity as we carry people to church on Sunday and have had as many as 15 on the run. We would buy it again. The only real problem we have had was with a engine sensor that only happened while traveling in the California Desert and that was only once. Haven't had any other issues. Would recommend this baby to anyone who wanted a roomy ride.

1999,13-12-2005,4,0.1027,3.875, Great van. We use it to tow the US Bobsled to shows. Gives great power and fuel mileage for such a large van. I'm looking foward to buying the new GM Diesel van. We also take it to a lot of Nascar Races. We are very active in racing selling our products to several teams and sponsor several teams. It's not uncommen to see Nascar drivers catching a ride in our van. It can seat 15 people. All in all very satisfied.

1999,15-12-2015,4,0.6705,4, bought this van new in 2005. The only repairs beside the normal (oil tires brakes fluids) was a water pump at 185000 miles. Put 191000 on this and was still going strong until i t was in a wreck. This was one of the most dependable vehicles i have ever owned.

2000,30-11-2004,4,0.9938,4.75,Very roomy vehicle. It will be great for long trips in the summer. Lots of leg room and easy to move around in. 
2000,01-03-2005,1,0.5719,4.875, So far so good with this van. It is a big vehicle and sits high off the road. I have the 5.0 ltr motor which gives it decent power. A little noisy when you punch it to merge with fast traffic. Brakes are spongy but work when required. It is great if you have lots of kids. It seats 6 people very nicely. Very roomy and the heater is great. Good handling but tends to pull in high winds. It is a highway cruiser vehicle however it handles nicely in town. Gas mileage is great. I like it a lot. I am glad I bought it. GMC makes a good quality vehicle which is why I bought this make of van. I have not yet drove it in deep snow which will be the real test for handling.

2001,03-09-2002,3,0.34,4.875, The 2001 Yukon XL is extremely comfortable and powerful.  The interior is perfect fit and feel for the driver and plenty of room for the kids and cargo.  I have the 2500 series and the ride is still smooth but a bit stiff.  With the 6.0 315 HP engine there is plenty of power but you pay for it in gas about 15 MPG.  I would highly recommend the purchase.  Adding a TV and DVD Player keeps the kids really quiet and makes trips effortless.

2003,21-02-2016,1,0,4,and performs up to expectations and 
2005,29-01-2005,1,0.7901,4.875,Better MPG and two items listed above. Dealership not very receptive to looking at AC!!!
2005,16-11-2005,4,0.7613,4.875,Definitely the AWD no wheel slip or spin! Plenty of power and tows well. Great vehicle for moving family and their stuff.
2005,14-10-2009,4,0.9682,3.5, Great vehicle for past 4 years. AWD has worked flawlesly and as good as a previous 4wd vehicle with a transfer case and certainly more convenient. Two problems...AC will not hold a charge more than one season...side swinging door hits front passenger door when both open and dents rear door on edge of front door really poor design (where were the engineers???)
2006,21-12-2015,4,0.4404,5, Have owned this from when it was new and I really like everything about it.
2007,17-03-2015,1,0,2.875," I am not usually one to write reviews on vehicles and I find it ironically funny that many people have the same complaints about their GMC Acadia that I do. I purchased this vehicle on a ""deal"" which I should have never done. Now looking back on it the 2007 was probably the worse year for this vehicle. I have already replaced my transmission the power steering has gone had to weld the exhaust twice and also had the rear-windshield washer hose leak all over the fuse box causing the entire vehicle to short out basically. So I laugh at people who write don't believe the reviews..... Well... you are wrong my friend. This vehicle should have been pulled off the market many times over!"
2007,18-11-2006,,0.3612,5, I looked at several different CUVs and SUVs and none had the interior refinement or power and economy as the Acadia. Great product.
2007,13-01-2007,,0.4215,5, Just bought. You should go look at car if you have a growing family.The car has standard bucket seats(credit if you want bench) The third seat is removable and the middle row moves foward and back. Adults comfortable in 3rd row. The pricing is like shopping for a Honda. You do not have to pay for all those extra options.They have FD and AWD. It is decieving from the outside and roomy inside. I love it. I also know it is first year out but it has everything I want in a luxury car without the price. Great Job GMC on your crossover. So far good gas mileage . Have not truly broken in yet. Still under the 500 mark.
2007,16-01-2007,,0.7681,5,Bucket seats. Children are older coming from surburban. Roomy. The design gas mileage good so far. The outside uses chrome and bigger tires. The dash uses red light. They thought of everything. Cup holders everywhere. Happy to downsize and airbags just like Honda.
2007,17-01-2007,,-0.4767,5, I looked at the F150 Titan and Tundra.The GM trucks were easily the best and of those two the GMC looks better. I rated my truck a 10 in every category except for fuel economy. I get around 18mpg mixed with the 5.3L 4x4 extended cab but they said that after a few thousand miles it will improve. So far only 1700 miles. The ride is great and the remote start has come in handy in warming up the interior these last few weeks.  Engine power is good.  Transmission is smooth and responsive. The 4x4 is responsive.
2007,26-01-2007,,0,5,  WE purchased this 07 model with 17k miles with in the 2 years of owning it. the timing chain alternator all 4 rotars head lamps and NOW transmission . it only has 47k miles and is my dream car being a mom of three children. it is every thing we were looking for with the third row black leather and rear dvd. but is 100% unsafe I have broke down way to many times to mention. and GMC is giving me a hard time Cause it is more then 5 years old .. Im discussed and starned. BUY forign
2007,18-03-2007,,0.9799,5,GM trucks are usually reliable but the 100000 powertrain warranty is great piece of mind.  It covers the 4x4 hardware engine and transmission. Get the backup warning and the G80 diff too- both must haves. My kids love the extended cab doors that swing out far it helps in tight parking lots.
2007,01-06-2007,,0.128,4.875, Quiet safe lots of useful space refined decent on gas drives like a car great looks. 
2007,01-07-2007,,0,4.875," We just picked up our loaded GMC Acadia Friday night and are extremely happy. The vehicle is well built inside and out and is a pleasure to drive. Lots of bells and whistles to keep you occupied in your spare time. I'm 6'2"" and I have more than enough room. This vehicle drives so smoothly it feels like your driving 55 when you're really going 85(oops!). Handling is superior to other vehicles we've owned. It's a real head turner when your driving down the road. I saw numerous Envoy owners trying to catch up with us to get a peak. The Acadia will be a real winner for GMC. The motor has more than enough power to get up and go. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone. Watch out Soccer Moms!"
2007,24-09-2007,,0.9447,2.5,"The looks and the power. When you step on the gas the truck waits for about a second and then the big vortec max kicks in almost as if the truck were saying ""Duh.. I'm a big powerful truck and I'll run over that Toyota Prius in front of me if you keep that pedal down!"""
2007,01-12-2007,,0.9708,4.875,"We like the 19"" wheels and the overall look and feel of the Acadia. Interior head and leg room are excellent. Exterior is sharp!The duel sun roofs really give it an open feeling. It's not a minivan!"
2007,15-03-2008,,0.1154,4.875, I just bought my truck a few days ago. I got the vortec max SLT. I was worried about such a big engine and fuel economy (6.0 liter) but when under moderate excelleration or on the highway it only uses 4 cylinders giving it better mileage than my mini-van that I traded in on it. It is very comfortable and the fit and finish of the leather and brushed aluminum trim competes with a Mercedes or BMW. The new design is way ahead of anything else I have seen on the road when people see it they can't help but notice it's size and intmidating looks. Yes I also got it because I have neer owned anything but a GM automobile but after driving it around I know I made the right choice.
2007,17-10-2008,,0.4201,5, Good looks abound with chrome wheels ground effects package and special fade paint exterior with standard roof to enable city garage parking. Easy pop-out center captain seats and electric rear seat converts to queen bed. In this position with appropriate protection on leather upholstery it's a real work horse to haul 4 X 8 materials ladders etc. Excellent towing ability.  Best of all a real comfortable 7 person touring vehicle with ample luggage storage and 22 mpg.
2007,24-08-2010,,0.9294,4.5,The dealership had a limited selection of extended cabs.  Maybe a crew cab with a longer bed would have been nice but they only come with the 5.5' bed for now so I got the extended cab with the 6.5' bed.  
2007,16-03-2011,,-0.1419,4.25,Doors don't sound solid like a Toyota  when they close small detail but still if GM is going to compete must think of things like this. Would be nice to have wood trim as an option and NAV as an option on mid-priced model.  
2007,23-08-2011,,0.6249,2.5,Engine and fuel economy.
2007,28-06-2012,,-0.1779,2.25, My wife and I are expecting our first child and we looked at every SUV CUV possible to find one that was reliable and safe for our new addition. As soon as we saw it on the lot we were in love. Chrome accents against the black and white background made for a shapr looking vehicle. The ride is great and smooth.  Engine is plenty powerful. Interior is nicely refined and very quiet. Rear legroom is unrivaled by any other vehicle. Rear sliding seat gives an extra 4 inches if needed for back seat passenger. Not badly priced either.
2007,29-08-2012,,0.9081,2.25,Doesn't look like a minivan but has identical functionality and then some aside from slightly less space behind the third row -- but not by much they have put a lot of space behind the third row in this crossover. 
2007,25-03-2013,,0.93,4.75,Everything about this vehicle is great.
2007,17-09-2013,,-0.4213,2.75,leather seats towing capacity roomy
2007,30-12-2013,,0.8065,2.375,I would have liked chrome wheels as an option. They will probably be available on the Denali version when it coes out.
2007,23-05-2015,,-0.6249,4.125,After owning a Yukon Delani I was looking forward to buying another GMC.
2007,27-12-2015,,0.0665,2, This car is by far the worst vehicle we've ever owned.
2007,28-02-2016,,-0.5556,1, I LOVE this car it was my dream car!!... But I HATE it... Transmisson replaces at 90000 needs another at 190000... Power steering went out 2 times... Liftgate issues (hydraulics and locking mechanism)... Sunroof LEAKS... Passanger windows stopped working at 100000... Radio also stopped work8ng at 150000... In general a MONEY PIT
2007,29-03-2016,,0,5, I have a 2007 Acadia with 70000 miles on it. I am having major transmission problems. It slips all the time. Some times it will not go into gear. It is very dangerous when exiting onto a highway. In addition there is a cover that apparently does not cover the power steering fluid/belt? they did not fully explain this well. The issue is when it really rains the car does not steer. So I have ended up in a median and some other odd places. Luckily no one has been hurt... yet. I get endles repairs on this car. I see others are having the same issues. [violative content deleted]
2007,09-06-2016,,0,2,None to date.

The handling is pretty good and fuel economy is what can be expected out of an AWD SUV. The vehicle comes with a lot of standard features(denali) like heated seats remote start etc. My only real problem is the 3rd row seat. Does not fold down to the ground and is made for children. Other models like the 2008 Toyota Sequoia and 2008 Lincoln Navigator can sit full grown adults back there and does fold down to the ground and other crossovers of GM do this so why not the full size SUVs.

2008,11-02-2015,,0,2, GM discovered that many Acadias recieved a defective wave plate during assembly.  The wave plate is a component in the transmission.  Instead of recalling the Acadia and having the part replaced GMC offered a special warranty up to 120000 miles to reimburse the cost of transmission repairs.  Of course since I actually take care of my car and drive it gently my wave plate lasted until 121500 miles.  The transmission repair cost $2700.  The problem was a defective waveplate.  GMC did not provide any assistance with the repair costs despite the fact it was barely beyond the warranty.  I'm actually somewhat thankful though.  Now I have a good excuse to buy a foreign car.  For the past 20 years I have always owned domestic vehicles...mostly GM vehicles because I have felt proud of supporting the domestic auto makers.  But with this latest issue it is apparent that GM has no interest in supporting their customers.  Now if people give me a hard time about buying foreign I can refer to this experience and people will understand.  This will be the last GM product I own.  I was going to buy a new Yukon in the Spring.  That won't be happening now.

The engine light came on at the same time my engine started smoking and hesitating in rush hour traffic.  OnStar ran a diagnostic and reported the findings to me. I had it towed in to the dealer they wouldn't tell me the problem until I told them that OnStar had already made it known to me. Four days later I drove my Acadia back home and fumes were coming through the air vents. I took it back to the dealer. They said the other fuel injectors had stopped working.

I paid more for the Acadia than I would have for another Yukon (with the factory and dealer spiffs they were giving back then). Turns out my Yukon got BETTER mileage! The Acadia is O.K. looks good reliable etc but it is more like driving a van than an SUV. My only complaint is the acceleration hesitation in wet and cold weather which nobody can seem to fix. Other than that no problems at all in the first 20k miles. But next time around Im back to a Yukon.

We like everything about the vehicle other than the gas mileage (16.5 MPG overall with much highway driving) and the front seats. The curve of the seat along with the forward angle of the headrest make it impossible to sit comfortably. I've tried every adjustment possible and can't get my upper back and neck to stop hurting.

It's had the timing chain replaced twice. The AWD system has malfunctioned. The sunroof is broken. The navigation unit has been changed twice. Numerous sensors have been replaced.  The emissions system has been a nightmare. I've spent a lot out of pocket cause most of it has not been under warranty.

After 20k miles it needed at timing chain. after 40k miles it needed another timing chain. Shortly after that the ac would cycle on off every 10 seconds. Took it to GMC for ac check and they said was ok. Took it back at least 8 times and they started changing parts and every time they touched it it got worse. Finally they told me it needed a new evaporator because it was leaking. So I took it to another shop for a 2nd opinion and they said they could not see or find any leaks. So back to GMC again and they started messing with the computer. Only to make it worse. Than Yesterday driving home I hear a growling noise coming from the tranny and than my car stoped and I had to get towed to GMC. The next day GMC told me the tranny was toast and it would cost 4400 dollars because I am out of warranty. This car has only 4300 miles on it and has never need driven hard.

Great interior space great features if you like the additional XM radio and ONstar services. No lag on the throttle... immediate response steady cornering and level steering. Superb traction control system; disengages acceleration when slipping on ice or when lack of traction stops engine RPM shootups. ABS system works great. It does weigh nearly 7000 lbs so braking is a bit more noticable at higher speeds (nose dive). After 5000+ miles I am averaging 16.3mpg / city and 20.2mpg hwy cruising at 70-75mph...23 or 24mpg as stated??? yeah right! Overall safety specs are sufficient; airbags all around great framework. well thought out interior heating and cooling system is loud enough to overpower a bluetooth phonecall when turned all the way up. remote start auto liftgate great features except when parked too close to something. bad side depth perception on back up cam. low road noise good stock tires (goodyear fortera comfort tread); bad for rain snow and ice... will hydroplane or loose traction at 45mph+ on standing water. upgrade tires to fortera triple tread (my opinion). steering wheel controls are oddly placed. front wipers on left stick rear wipers on center console below a/c system controls why? volume and radio controls in a good consolidated location on steering wheel. good location for cruise control buttons. three locations for liftgate operations (key on liftgate and next to rear wipers.. why?) auto dimming rear view mirror great black lower trim around Acadia difficult to clean need special cleaner from autoparts store. a little above average accessory selection great audio even without BOSE radio buttons can be confusing double vanity lighted shades dual exhaust great feature. battery location inconvenient (center of car between 2nd row captain seats) deep lubricated slide rails for 2nd row captain seats much debris can be lodged or stuck in there not good. inside material ""plastic"" poor choice of material easily scuffed marked up and just unsightly. Maintenance costs are average for this type of vehicle. Great interior storage capacity (glovebox center console armrest area and rear liftgate area."

2011,02-05-2011,,-0.4215,5,May 2013 a year after buying the vehicle we're on our 2nd time fixing the air conditioning (approx $1000/time) and there's an oil drip.
2011,23-05-2011,,0,5,"Quality--the struts for the rear hatch broke 400 miles after the warranty expired. The A/C has been putting off a nasty urine smell for 20k miles that the service department conveniently couldn't smell. It is also hissing loudly. The left front brake/suspension is making clunking noises (again service department couldn't ""hear"" it). Transmission is rough. No hill-assist. We're trading it in ASAP for a BMW X5. We are done with American cars. "
2011,28-06-2011,,0,3,No other SUV in its class offers all of what we were looking for: a 3rd row with captains chairs and a reasonable amount of space behind the 3rd row when it's up to haul a stroller or load groceries.
2011,08-12-2011,,0.7469,3.875,DVD player broke after a week of owning it. Fortunately it was just barely covered under warranty.
2011,29-02-2012,,-0.659,5, Loving this car. Very impressed with the ride the power the options. This vehicle handles amazing for what it is. We are very satisfied so far. Love the Bose too
2011,17-05-2013,,0,2.625, Purchased a used (28k miles) 2011 Acadia in April 2012. Test drove and was tempted to buy a Toyota Highlander or VW Touareg but loved the body style and features of the Acadia.
2011,04-08-2014,,-0.296,2.25, We purchased the 2011 Denali brand-new kept it well and were rewarded with poor quality. The first year was fine--the lack of technology was a nuisance but the car fit my very tall family so I was willing to overlook that. But simple things like the non-qwerty keypad in the CD-based nav system really wore on me. GM stayed solvent by skimping on technology and it's painfully apparent in this model year. Our '06 BMW 3-series has better technology.

2011,13-11-2015,,-0.8225,1, I felt the need to report since I read these when deciding what to buy. This thing is awesome! really. took our first good trip this weekend and this car handles and drives incredibly. 8090 100mph no problem. It floats at all speeds. 100 mph was deceiving because it handled so smooth. twisty roads were also gobbled up with ease. plenty of room for the kids and our stuff. Love it! We'll be keeping this for a long while
2011,10-11-2016,,-0.2244,2,Interior space decent exterior styling
2012,24-07-2011,,0,2.25,We like the smooth ride and quietness of it. The pilot is louder by far.
2012,24-08-2011,,0.8266,4.875,Big problem is with carbon monoxide. This vehicle sets off alarms in our house when started in the garage ( garage door open of course). Service dept is like a human rain delay in trying to get it fixed. Fot the 55k spent on top of the line we had many other choices cant imagine them being any worse. When not thinking about the CO it rides nice.
2012,29-02-2012,,-0.4767,3.375,Sun roofs lots of cup holders great captain seats.
2012,05-03-2012,,0,4.125," I looked at everything & mean everything! It came down to the Dodge Durango Jeep GC Toyota 4Runner & Acadia. I rented a Durango and Jeep for a couple of days. Both of them had driving positions that didnt allow me to read the gauges because the steering wheel blocked it. In the Jeep the A Pillar is way to wide & the roof line to low to be comfortable. With the rear seats down the Durangos load floor was so high that my dog was breathing down my neck and could be pitched out the side window. The 4runner was nice but the rear air vents were blocked when rear seat was folded flat the passenger seat sits very high and is not adjustable plus no sunroof delete available in my state(Im 6'3"")."
2012,13-03-2012,,0,4.125,My 2012 Acadia has revised my opinion of American quality. A very sophisticated work of engineering...very much on a par with the German product as well as the Japanese...and at a more realistic purchase price ...and very much more reasonable service charges.
2012,08-04-2012,,-0.7177,5, I rate this vehicle very high.
2012,08-07-2012,,0.6557,4.875,Problem is that the Denali mode does not allow for snow chains...ever.
2012,16-07-2012,,0,3.875, We have driven Japanese vehicles for the last 15 years we have a 2010 pilot right now as the wife's car and they have all been stellar.
2012,02-08-2012,,0,4.875,We live in the Pacific Northwest so AWD is great for the rain.
2012,25-08-2012,,-0.5213,3.875,This was never told to us at the dealership and now we feel pretty stupid for not asking up front but it did not occur to us.
2012,30-09-2012,,-0.9565,4.125, When I was a kid we had Packards ( Ask the man who owns one ) ...after that we drove Chevys & Cadillacs. In the 80's we switched to German iron since all the US auto makers fell flat on quality.
2012,06-12-2012,,-0.0258,4.625,Don't know if models with smaller rims might accommodate chains but don't upgrade to the Denali model is you want to spend any time in the snow.
2012,20-12-2012,,0.4201,3.75,The build quality seems on pr with the Hondas the material quality is a step below the pilot.
2012,30-12-2012,,0.1508,4.625,"I liked the more utilitarian styling of the SLE model. Its not ""blinged"" out and looks more like a traditional GMC should. I didn't want my SUV to look like a car. I like the power-liftgate off switch. If you own a dog or in a low garage/parking structure you will too! Besides I don't have the patience to wait for it to open/close nor risk my dog deciding he wants to escape when its going down. Drives really smooth and don't agree with edmunds review of it being bland to drive or hard to maneuver due to its size. I like the heft and substantial feel..doesn't feel like a car but its also not as clumsy or porky feeling as piloting a Yukon/Tahoe. Finally the 4 rear A/C vents are great!"
2012,26-01-2013,,0.3612,4.5, Bought this SUV as a family hauler.
2012,04-05-2013,,0.1154,3.75, Decent ride a bit underpowered but MPG ok. Very comfortable and tons of room even with three kids in the back. Seats take awhile to heat up.
2012,11-01-2014,,0.6249,4.125,Diesel version? Stop trying to poison our family! or at least have a clue on how to fix it.
2012,20-12-2014,,0.8576,4.625,The interior is very plastic looking but not much different from the 2009 GMC Sierra Crew Cab pickup I had (fyi-the 2013 interior is revised). Its early but its a bit of a gas pig. However its a 2.5 ton vehicle w/AWD so I expected to pay more at the pump. The driver seat is way to soft..I have already built up the seat foam using a professional auto upholstery shop. The head rests are terrible and can hit some people in the neck/shoulders and having to have them shaved down as well. Its a shame GMC has ruined resale by using these as rental vehicles. I two year leased mine knowing the used car market is flooded with the Acadia/Traverse. Found it difficult to find low optioned AWD SLE's .
2012,02-02-2016,,0.3818,4, We really like the way that it drives and looks.
2012,20-01-2017,,0,4,I have been admiring the Acadia for some time.
2013,15-12-2012,,0,5, I've had my 2013 Acadia for about 4 weeks.
2013,13-02-2013,,0.6249,3.5, Downsizing from driving Yukon XL Denalis since 2003 I was excited to see the Denali trim in the medium sized Acadia.
2013,26-02-2013,,0,3.25,My Yukons never let me down so I was a little bias'd toward the GMC line.
2013,24-05-2013,,0,4.25, We previously drove a Buick Enclave for 5 years so we knew what to expect with the Lambda platform which is shared between the Chevy Traverse GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave.
2013,15-06-2013,,0.9477,3.125,We traded back a 6 month old Durango Citadel to go back to a GM 7/8 passenger CUV (Buick to GMC). Overall the GMC Acadia is light years better with fit and finish and luxury touches though there are a handful of items that the Acadia lacks for $50k+ that should be corrected sooner than later. A digital speedometer and gauge is expected at this price point (appears to be limited to existing gauge cluster). So is keyless ignition and collision avoidance at least as an option. The other notable difference is realizing how good the Dodge's Mercedes based drivetrain is compared to the aging Lambda platform. The Acadia is heavy and took a little getting used to after coming out of the Dodge.
2013,27-06-2013,,0.8583,4.625,Overall one of the best values for the content and quality that GM now offers in this segment.
2013,28-06-2013,,0,3,The Acadia is a very nice looking cross-over but as they say beauty is only skin deep.
2013,03-04-2015,,0.34,3.875,I tossed between the Benz 350 Nissan Pathfinder Infiniti XJ and the Acadia.
2013,11-04-2015,,0.7845,5,"The look of the GMC with refreshed front and year. LED headlamps are striking and similar to CUV's costing much more. The Denali trim is much improved with panels being better integrated with the body less chrome and better options for 20"" wheels with machined alloys that support the GMC brand as advertised. Interior fit and finish with stitched dash and wood trim detail make for pleasing trips to the mall or a trip to the beach. The Acadia is large and can accommodate a large amount of gear."
2013,10-05-2015,,0.34,4,The refresh has given this CUV what we consider a more truck like presence which appeals to both the male and female driver in our family. Fit and finish is what one would expect from GM with improvements made to the transmission in the Acadia (no more searching for gears up hills) less flashy wheel offerings and better integrated telematics (bluetooth nav DVD).
2013,14-07-2016,,0.8045,4,I have driven it 1000 miles and all I can say is shame on you GMC.
2013,04-04-2017,,0,2,Great car.
2017,22-10-2016,,0.5617,5, Loved my '08 Acadia and I felt no need to change horses when it came time for replacement. So far I have driven this only in good weather so I can't comment at all on rain/snow driving. This model seems noticeably quieter than my 08 and seems a bit more peppy. Driving is smooth I can't think of a thing to criticize in a major way but I have some  quibbles. The Infotainment system may have some improvements over my old system but it doesn't seem as intuitive. For one thing I can't figure out how to mark the location where I am sitting and if it's in the manual show me where!  The feature was drop-dead easy in my old Acadia. The manual by the way is poorly thought out and lacking detail. The electronics are great! Blind spot alert feature is very helpful and a must-have. Backup camera as well. Color we chose was Sparkling silver and it's gorgeous!
2017,06-01-2017,,0.9323,5, I owned a 2014 Acadia Denali before but after purchasing the 2017 Acadia Limited I find it to be every bit as good if not better than it's predecessor.  The only thing I miss is the power tilt and telescope steering wheel. But the manually adjusted function in the 2017 Limited is easy to adjust and I'm sure it will not be any problem in the near future. The up grades to the 2017 Limited are really amazing. Wish they would have been available in the 2014 Denali but that is the difference in 3 years of technology upgrades. I prefer the size of the Limited  as opposed to the new smaller 2017 Acadia. My wife and I just purchased our new Limited in March and drove to St Louis and back to Vero Beach FL averaging 23 mpg. We are pleased!
2017,04-12-2017,,0.9844,5, I have only owned an Acaidia for a short time we purchased a 2015 certified pre owned which we love.  It needed service and we received a loaner which was a 2017 Acaidia Limited.  Both cars are amazing.  I hope that GMC doesn't  stop production of the larger size SUV.
2017,07-12-2017,,0.8976,5," Have been driving it for two weeks and absolutely love it.  Acceleration is peppy - handling is wonderful road noise is low and love that it is 7"" shorter than our Buick Enclave.  Apple car play is handy."
