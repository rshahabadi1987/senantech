How about replacing my wheel covers that rattle every time I drive my Tacoma. It sounds like  a garbage truck coming down the street. The dealership tells me it's an engineering problem but they could fix it for $300. Plus they can't guarantee it's a permanent fix. They also tell me there have been many other complaints. What gives Toyota?,Trish Wyble  How about replacing my wheel covers that rattle every time I drive my Tacoma. It sounds like  a garbage truck coming down the street.
