Fiat Motor Corp,2012,08/02/2012,Q1 2012,0,4.5,Some parts of the interior seem cheap - plastic bolt under glove box has popped out leaving the upholstery flapping gear shift ring broke etc. Outside the paint is peeling on the strip between the sunroof and front windshield. The worst issue is the clutch dying suddenly at 28000 miles (no slipping no burning clutch smell to warn you it just worked and then it didn't in my case in the middle of an intersection.) I've driven stick all my life and never run through a clutch that quickly. Peruse the forums and reviews for the 2012 FIAT 500 Manual Transmission and you'll see I'm not alone. No help from the dealership either.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2012,01/03/2012,Q1 2012,-0.8454,3.125, I bought my new 2012 Fiat 500 Pop on 12/22/2011.,,,,

Fiat Motor Corp,2012,24/01/2016,Q1 2012,0,3,That day I noticed electrical problems and that the leak wasn't repaired. Returned it to the shop More open body seams were found around the windshield. I requested a replacement. Fiat agreed. The dealership acquired my replacement on 02/10/2012 but has yet to get it to me (03/01). My Fiat Case Manager is Kathy Nelson but I have no way to contact her. I regret my purchase.,,,,

Fiat Motor Corp,2012,08/04/2015,Q2 2012,-0.34,3.25, I want to love this car but one of the main reasons I bought it was for its afFord Motor Corpability and I haven't even had it 2 years and I'm already paying 10% of the original cost in repairs! I bought it one year used with 11000 miles on it. It's now 28000 at miles and it's had problems with everything from cosmetic issues like peeling paint to an air bag sensor failure to a very serious no-warning clutch failure (which was not covered under warranty after 15000 miles). The clutch replacement at a FIAT dealer has taken 10 days so far and is costing a small fortune. It's a fun car but just not holding up! I always drove a Subaru or Toyota Motor Corp before and I think it may be time to go back. ,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2012,08/04/2015,Q2 2012,-0.3661,2.75,AfFord Motor Corpable (assuming you don't need repairs that aren't covered by the warranty) cute good gas mileage handles well given the small engine (struggles a little on hills) makes parking easy back seat folds down easily to carry a decent amount of cargo. ,,,,

Fiat Motor Corp,2012,07/07/2015,Q3 2012,0,3.125,It's 101hp so your not going to win any drag races... but you can throw this car into any corner on ramp or off ramp almost at any speed and it will just go exactly where you point it!,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2012,04/08/2015,Q3 2012,-0.4172,2, I was driving at a speed of 55 mph when without any warning my car shut off.  Thank God I or someone else was not hurt. My fiat is a 2012 with 53000 miles on it.  The only thing Ive had to do is replace both brake lights at the same time and a headlight. When the car died I could not get my key out of the ignition nor could I get the car out of gear.  It had totally locked up.  Just called the dealership and the car wont even communicated with the computer to find out whats wrong. Sounds expensive to me.  ,,,,

Fiat Motor Corp,2013,12/02/2013,Q1 2013,0.8225,4.75,"The seats bother my lower back on longer trips.  I dropped the money for wet okole seat covers with lumbar support and now they are pretty good.  Given that getting leather seats was a waste and maybe the cloth would have been better on my back.  Blue and me interface is pretty low tech and user un-friendly but not a deal breaker.  Beats audio is better than stock but still not great.  If you get 17"" wheels with summer tires you will need dedicated snow tires if you ever touch snow/ice.  ",,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2013,01/03/2013,Q1 2013,0.7656,4.875,After having had my Fiat 500 for two months I feel that I know the car well and can comment on it.,,,,

Fiat Motor Corp,2013,16/01/2015,Q1 2013,0.4215,4.25, Up front I'll say that I love this car and it is great for my needs.  But this is absolutely a niche vehicle that is lots of fun as a run-about but gives up a lot in utility/flexibility.  There is no way I would have bought this as an only car in the household--something like a GTI would make way more sense or a Focus ST if you wanted more edginess.  That said I felt the Abarth had way more character was more fun and was more unique for a hot hatch.  It feels a more raw and simple than the competition--which I like.  It gets me to work every day puts a smile on my face when I drive it gets good gas mileage and for short trips fits a family of three and groceries for a couple of days.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2013,13/03/2015,Q1 2013,0.9704,5,Was considering other small/light 'fun' cars such as the Mini/Mazda Mx5/BRZ-FRS but for similar performance/features it would be 10K more anyway I just kind of fell in love with it after a test drive.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2013,22/03/2015,Q1 2013,0.7783,4.875, I test drove many cars looking for a cost effective economical car that would be a fun everyday driver while still be great on gas.  I test drove a Mini Cooper S convertible for 7 days and found it to be a noisy cheap car that really felt like a poorly built cheap car (shame on you BMW).  I looked at the beetle (just ok) focus (awful style) fiesta (nothing more to say) and many more but just could not find the fun factor I wanted.  Then I happened upon a Fiat Abarth 500C and thought that looked interesting.  I test drove it ... and wow ... it was incredible.  It was perfect!  It had the fun factor with the exhaust note convertible 5-speed and the power is great.  It also gets great gas mileage low insurance cost can seat 4 (yes the back seats are small but work just fine) feels solid/stable and best of all a low mileage used car can be found for under 19k ... and then I find that the warranty is 4 years/50k ... Bonus!  I have since put over 25000 trouble free miles on this car including a couple of long distance trips.  This car never fails to make me smile and always a willing partner to have some fun.  On top of that I get many comments on how nice the car looks because it is a limited edition Abarth 500c.  For 2013 there were only 250 imported to the USA ... so it is extremely rare to even see another one.  LOVE my car!,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2013,23/03/2015,Q1 2013,0.9974,4,after 11000 miles in just under 3 months not a single problem  rattle  or squeak . Maybe I bite the bullet and go for an Orange Turbo at the end of the year anything but silver or grey . I'm sick of seeing silver cars .,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2013,03/03/2017,Q1 2013,-0.5455,4, I have always purchased new vehicles so was quite concerned buying a used lease vehicle make by Fiat. But after a month I am impressed with this little electric car! I decided to investigate leasing an electric while idling my V-8 in commute traffic and ended up buying this Fiat. With the gas and bridge toll savings this used car will pay for itself in about 5 years plus reduced wear and maintenance on my Jeep. The biggest downside so far is the lack of Fiat service centers.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2013,16/04/2013,Q2 2013,-0.2244,5,With the 17-inch wheels and P-zero tires this light weight car feels fast and nimble not always stable on the edge. Provided you keep it in the mid-rev range the torque is strong and turbo lag is not an issue. ,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2013,15/05/2013,Q2 2013,0.0031,4.875, I am an old dude 53 I have a Light seafoam green with ivory interior 2013 500 pop 5 speed with a sunroof  alum wheels and beats stereo  on top of all the other goodies that just come standard on this car . It rocks  fun  fast  stable quiet  I've owned one of just about everything over the years from Pintos to Porsches  literally. This is hands down one of my favorites. My only complaint is that the turbo doesn't come in ANY color I want!,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2013,20/05/2014,Q2 2013,0.8172,4.25,  Abarth is ultimately more fun than my old mustang or Z a little power house that doesn't shy away from a fight love the engine growl and the kick more room than you think awesome bang for the buck .,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2013,28/05/2014,Q2 2013,0.9008,5,Exhaust is great fun meaty and quick turbo engine good grip extremely easy to park in those spaces no one else can fit in.  I love the pops and backfires when you lift off the throttle quickly or when changing gears.  I like the high seating position. I really like the old style analog concentric gauge cluster--I have no problem quickly interpreting the data as some have reported.  Looks are great with the gray-tint headlight/tail light option.  I like the Abarth stripes--what the heck might as well with a car like this!,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2013,07/06/2014,Q2 2013,0.9806,4.5, When Fiat left the US market oh so long ago I was not happy.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2013,28/07/2015,Q3 2013,-0.4585,5,This car replaced a turbo diesel car so needing fast acceleration was not a requirement. The first week of ownership I put mine and my wife's road bikes on the back and took off on a thousand mile drive to participate in a week long bike ride in Northern Idaho. We had to cross the continental divide and drive over many types of roads. This car has extremely comfortable seats and except for the extreme climbs has enough power. We averaged 35 mpg for the trip. Since then it is averaging 35-39 mpg with mostly city driving. We have had no problems great a/c and no rattles. Love this CAR,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2013,04/08/2015,Q3 2013,0.7778,5,By that time I had owned a very used 128 wagon a new X-1/9 and then a new 131 Brava.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2013,30/09/2015,Q3 2013,0,5, You have to try it.. you may love or hate it - but it really is a fun car for 'enthusiast' drivers. Great value provided you don't pay the MSRP (I got mine (with 3 year tire insurance - which I already used once for a repair) for 19K US$ + tax with end of year discounts of 6K.),,,,

Fiat Motor Corp,2013,01/11/2013,Q4 2013,0.4902,4.75, Just leased this. Really impressed with fit finish and fun to drive performance! Easy to exceed rated MPGe. With sweet lease deal total cost of car is less than I was spending on gasoline alone each month. Range is OK better than others except Tesla and Volt. Getting by with included slooow 120V charge device others may desire $800 optional fast charger. Costs $1 per day for electricity to drive 40 miles previous vehicle was $10 per day for gas. Very impressive car hope future models offer extended range and lower cost batteries. My SUV will last forever now parked except when needed!,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2013,09/11/2013,Q4 2013,0.9799,5, I have now had the Fiat for 30 months. I still love the car. I have had no problems with it  and the dealership where I bought it gives great service. The only complaint that I have is that with the stock tires that it does not do well in deep snow. This is only a problem on my street which is not plowed.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2013,14/12/2013,Q4 2013,-0.0808,4.5, 1500 miles on my 500e. Lease $200 month. $2500 total down $2500 rebate from state of CA. Aero environment 220 charger installed today compliments of State of CA. Est monthly fuel cost to drive 1000 miles approx $35 per SMUD utility rep. 500e total car expenditure less than gas and routine maintenance alone on my MB C230...like winning a free car in a contest. Enough ACCT 101. This little thing is pretty fun. Very spunky and quick off the line. Easily separates from ICE cars off green lights. Great around town car or 2nd car. I drove it 95 miles very gently today and had 10% charge left. ,,,,

Fiat Motor Corp,2013,01/11/2015,Q4 2013,-0.1027,5,Update 35000 miles still having fun..range is about 85-90 miles now..,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2013,23/11/2016,Q4 2013,0,5, I love the looks and handling. This would make an awesome commuting car; however it would be a little tight for passengers in the back seats. The typical downsides are minimal range (<100 miles) and takes at least four hours to charge from 'empty.',,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2014,06/01/2014,Q1 2014,0.8519,2.25,To start off I love the transmission but I've adapted my driving habits to ensure its longevity. It is after all an automatically shifted manual- not a slush box.  What I'm talking about is for example to select the gear you want using the manual mode when in stop and go traffic in particular when you're creeping along and I always put it in neutral if I'm going to be stopped for any length of time. The reasons for driving the DDCT in this way are a bit technical and maybe that's why dual clutch transmissions haven't caught on so well stateside. In any case for 2015 all but the Pop trim come with the Aisin slush box if you opt for an auto transmission. ,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2014,16/02/2014,Q1 2014,0.5126,4.875,We now have a son who is almost 1 and he's spent his entire life thus far riding in this car.  With the car seat in the middle it's a little cramped in the back but nothing bad. ,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2014,21/02/2014,Q1 2014,0.5824,5,This vehicle has all the features of the pricier Honda Motor Corp CRV at about 5K less -- and it looks better and handles better on the road. Last month I took it on a 800 miles road trip and it was so enjoyable to drive.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2014,28/03/2014,Q1 2014,0.8605,4.625,The smooth shifting 6 speed manual.  1.4 turbo that is very willing.  Huge interior for a car this small.  Bluetooth Nav backup camera.  Value.  These cars are CHEAP now that theyve got a bad rap.  From what Ive heard avoid the automatic and youll be fine or wait for the 2015 and its conventional automatic tranny.  New 2014 ones are deeply discounted and I just bought a used 2014 in Jan of 2015 with only 3k miles for $12500!  You cant beat that value with any other car on the market!!  Heck I love it when Consumer reports blasts a perfectly good car.  Just makes them that much cheaper to buy!!  Give this car a chance if you can drive a stick.  You wont regret it!!!,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2014,24/02/2015,Q1 2014,0.9463,4.625, Like someone else said this is one of the most underrated small cars on the market today.  It's well documented that Americans don't like wagons or minivans for that matter.  Well apparently neither do most auto journalists because this car is lambasted in every pupublication.  Just go drive one for yourself these are TONS of fun. In Colorado here at this elevation Turbos and their forced induction rule the land.  Maybe in Texas at sea level this car seems pokey but in this thin air this 1.4 direct inject turbo runs hard and is a blast to drive. I upgraded from a Mini Clubman and LOVE the fact I can fit 3 car seats wide.  To be fair I have the 6 speed manual so no automatic problems here.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2014,12/01/2016,Q1 2014,0.8047,5, We've had our 500L for 2 years now though have only put on 14K miles so far and it's my wife's daily driver. Ours is the Trekking trim with the 6 speed Dual-Dry-Clutch Transmission. In response to an earlier recent review where the reviewer gave the car just 1 star my experience couldn't be more different. ,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2014,29/01/2016,Q1 2014,0,4, Overall this has been a good car for us.  We've taken a number of long-ish trips (3-8 hours in the car) and we've never had an issue.  It's a comfortable ride (I'm 5'10 my wife 5'4 and we both fit comfortably in front or in back. ,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2014,02/02/2016,Q1 2014,0.8957,4, I have put 45000 miles on my 500L Trekking in 27 months. It is driven 3-5 days a week to work 24 miles one way. I have made numerous trips of 300 to 450 miles one way. I find the front seats become uncomfortable only on the longest trips. I track my MPG since new and average 30.3 MPG. My best is 39.8. I have the auto transmission and I did have to get used to it. It does not always shift smoothly. I had a problem with the engine check light due to a fuel vac leak. The leak was never found and the problem stopped over a year and a half ago. I love the dashboard. I like a simple layout and feel the FIAT gives it to me. The view from the drivers seat is beyond compare. Cargo room is great. I can carry 2x4x8 boards in the car. It has been a great little car. The TECH package was the selling point for me. The backup camera is awesome.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2014,24/02/2016,Q1 2014,0.91,5, I bought this new in March of 2015. Advertised $8000 off MSRP. Great buy.  The turbo kicks in @ 3000 rpm's and it becomes a rocket! Easy access massive headroom.  I have 10000 miles and no problems.  I personally love the European Automatic Transmission (DCA). Feels like a manual without the clutch Most new 2016 models at the dealers have an American Automatic. Guess some people didn't like the DCA. Plenty of trunk space Always get great mileage.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2014,25/03/2016,Q1 2014,0.9493,5,Overall I consider the Fiat Abarth to be an excellent alternative to a big sport touring bike for those of us who have outgrown (literally and figuratively) motorcycles.  Evening blasts through the countryside w/ the windows down cruising around town listening to the burbling exhaust running it up through the gears and stints on the interstate are all at least 95% as much fun as I'd have on a motorcycle.  The roof windshield wipers HVAC heated seats stereo airbags luggage space and relative comfort (for two!) more than make up for the other 5% of lost performance and 'freedom'.  And my lightly used Abarth was much cheaper than any of the big sport touring bikes.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2014,06/06/2015,Q2 2014,0.7424,2.75,The trunk doesn't fit the jogger stroller very well well just enough for the stroller and nothing else.  It will fit in the front seat (upside down) but it makes reaching the shifter a bit awkward.  We really should have gotten a larger car but my wife LOVED the unique look of the car and the fact that you just don't see many of them around.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2014,04/04/2016,Q2 2014,0.8415,4, I loved my 2012 500c but found myself needing something a little larger.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2014,08/04/2016,Q2 2014,0.3506,5,UPDATE - The Abarth continues to impress!  I've put about 5000 miles on it and everything continues to work as it should.  Overall fuel mileage remains 30 mpg average in mixed driving.  I recently took the Abarth on a nice long road trip up to PA and it was great fun hurtling along the backroads of MD and eastern PA.  Third and 4th gears are perfect for that kind of thing.  The Abarth is surprisingly comfortable on the Interstate but I prefer secondary roads if only to allow me to use the gearbox more!  Many folks complain about the shifter but I find that it works just fine.  The throws might be a tad on the long side but engagement is precise and shifts can be very smooth.  The leather wrapped Abarth steering wheel and shifter are both a pleasure to use.  The 'sport' button on the dashboard provides a noticeable bump in power but I usually don't bother w/ it.  The brakes are VERY good.  As noted by some others the turning diameter is about the same as most mid sized SUVs which is surprising.  Apparently the Abarth modifications to the front suspension required it.  I've adjusted but it's ironic to drive such a small car and have to plan ahead in some parking situations as if you were driving a truck.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2014,25/04/2016,Q2 2014,0.9825,4,UPDATE Sept. 28 2016 - I'm over a year in with my used 2014 Abarth and I still love it.  A ball joint started creaking in the front suspension but that was repaired under the excellent 4 year/50000 mile bumper to bumper warranty.  At my rate of driving I'll be able to enjoy full warranty coverage through August of 2018!  My local Fiat service department is primarily a Dodge shop and customer service is TERRIBLE.  But the Fiat mechanics seem solid and the annual oil change was only $68 for full synthetic. The Abarth has proven to be very reliable and I'm looking forward to some autumn road trips.  I added a $15 Bluetooth dongle for the aux input and now I can enjoy streaming music from my phone as well as the standard Bluetooth phone integration.  Later models have better Bluetooth capability standard.  Bottom line - If you are looking for a fun inexpensive second car you should definitely test drive a 500 Abarth.  The bang for the buck is tremendous and it's an absolute blast to bomb around in.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2014,21/06/2016,Q2 2014,0.9732,4, It's a shame this car has gotten such bad press. I know some have had bad experiences but I've read about others who have had wonderful experiences with this car. You can almost park this car almost anywhere -- I believe it's length is a few inches shorter than a Toyota Motor Corp Corolla -- yet it has such room inside for passengers and cargo. It's not a sports car but it handles well enough and rides comfortably on all but the roughest or bumpiest roads. As of this writing I have had no issues at all; just normal maintenance. The bad press has probably affected sales so look carefully for a good deal if you're shopping for one.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2014,19/05/2017,Q2 2014,0.5295,5, This is so much fun to drive.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2014,19/07/2013,Q3 2014,0.5542,5,So what am I to do?? Not drive the car in USA stop and go traffic?!,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2014,13/08/2013,Q3 2014,-0.4646,3.375," I really like my new 500L but it does not like me. After 6 days 350ml it broke down in stop and go traffic on I-25 outside Denver. The twin clutch automatic heated up smoked and therefore the system shut down. Had roadside assistance tow it back to the Fiat dealer. After setting for three days the car started okay and was drivable. The dealer could not find any problems the engineer in Italy could not find any problem with the readout data. Their comment was that with the stop and go traffic the 500L twin clutch automatic acted ""normally"".",,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2014,21/07/2014,Q3 2014,0.5283,5,I do hate to see Fiat get such a bad rep.  Even though I have the stick shift it would be nice to see the 500l have less problems especially with the auto.  Mine had the cold start problems but was correctly diagnosed by the dealer to be a weak battery from the factory. The service advisor said that many of these 500 L came here with bad batteries possibly due to sitting in the shipping yard for a few months.

Fiat Motor Corp,2014,26/09/2015,Q3 2014,0.7959,5, I love my Abarth.  It's our second car but we've already taken it on one long road trip.  It is a very fun car to drive and feels much faster than it is.  I'm surprised how comfortable it is given all the negative press I've read.  For 2 six foot adults the car is perfectly comfortable.  Miles per gallon are better than EPA estimates but smiles per gallon are off the charts.  The touch points in the cabin are very nice even if there is a lot of hard plastic.  No complaints at all.  Comfortable fun economical practical and it sounds awesome when you run it up through the gears!  Buy a lightly used one and you won't regret it.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2014,01/10/2014,Q4 2014,0.9932,5,Some criticize the 500L for having too firm of a ride but to me it is sublime giving a very nice balance between ride and handling. The steering weights up nicely as you turn in though I wish the turn-in response were a little sharper. It is very stable once into a corner and it's fun to hustle it if you're in the mood though the car is really excellent at just cruising on a sunny day esp. if you've opted for the panoramic roof.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2014,19/10/2014,Q4 2014,0.9858,4.125, I bought a Fiat 500L Trekking in September 2013. To be honest it took me quite awhile to get used to its rather quirky transmission -- and I have a manual!! The issue was the six gears and the need for a quick shift between first and second. But now that I have gotten used to how and when to shift I am very happy with my purchase.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2014,18/12/2015,Q4 2014,0.835,5,I traded in the cabrio for the new 500L and am very pleased with it so far.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2014,28/12/2015,Q4 2014,0.4927,1," I've had no problem with the car rolling backwards on a slight incline when pulling away from a stop and hill hold assist works well when on any incline greater than ""slight"".  The engine has proven to be plenty quick enough for merging with traffic etc. and frugal if you're easy on the gas. I've gotten upwards of 39 mpg when on back roads with no traffic 34 or so on interstates 25 to 27 in town (lots of cold starts routinely so the economy suffers a bit for that).  ",,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,22/01/2015,Q1 2015,-0.6326,5, I bought my 2015 fiat 500 pop six months ago from Car Pros Fiat of Renton that's when my troubles started... at the first rain I found out that my car has a leak car did not have even 500 miles when I took it to get serviced in staid of giving me a new car they repaired it and this is only the beginning.... stereo problem done the software update no changes had the engine check light that went on  the heater takes 20 MIN to defog at full power driver seat latch sticks and now another leak. The car has only 3030 miles and it has been repaired 6 times. Till this moment Fiat USA and the dealership is still giving me the turn around. After a months of calling and sending emails I finally got an answer from fiat acknowledging that there is problems with this car and they offer an extended warranty... really  you think I will keep a car with so many problems. Now I found water again in the back of my car it's three times now.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,22/02/2015,Q1 2015,-0.9062,5,It has lots of room both front and back and handles like a European Car should handle. It cuts and turns quickly and holds the road beautifully. All of that while maintaining a comfortable ride.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,10/03/2015,Q1 2015,0.8074,4.875," Although the MSRP is $16000 I paid $13000 for a brand new 2015 model on Black Friday after a lot of negotiating. While the price is the best feature of this car putting an afFord Motor Corpable nice new car within reach of anyone at any income level the FIAT just has so many other great qualities on top of that. It gets 40 miles per gallon on the freeway and I average 34 including city driving in my typical commute. It easily reaches freeway speeds and feels very safe and comfortable at 75 MPH. It has excellent handling in all circumstances. The interior was actually ""designed"" not ""thrown together."" The manual transmission is very fun to drive with even when it's not in sport mode.",,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,23/03/2015,Q1 2015,0.9839,5, After one year of ownership I fully stand by my first review.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,14/01/2016,Q1 2015,0,5," Lease terms are great when combined with rebates from California State and Central Valley.   Car is a hoot to drive: fast and responsive with great handling.   It also is cute and sophisticated looking.   Range is about 100 miles in the relatively flat Central Valley.   This car works great as a city commuter and carries our shopping purchases easily in the ""trunk"" and the extra space made by folding down the rear seats.  We are family of two ""empty nesters"" so although this car is an addition to our gas engine vehicles (bought to complement our newly installed solar array on the rooftop) it has become the favorite car to use.   Front seats are fine but rear seats are a bit cramped.  Controls are ""interesting"" reflecting Italian design!!   The integrated info system in 2016 is a bit improvement over previous models.  In addition the interior white/black color scheme is practical but classy.   We have had no problem in the city or on the highway.  Beware that this car does not allow Level 3 charging so expect to wait a bit longer for it to charge with Level 2 at public charing stations or a lot longer with the Level 1 charger that comes with the car.",,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,19/01/2016,Q1 2015,0.9421,1,This is a follow up to the review I did last year. I have put about 7000 miles on her like I said I don't drive much and she is still doing great. I really have no complaints at all about this car. We even traded in our Mini for the 500X and we love it as well.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,06/02/2016,Q1 2015,0.8155,4, Let me first say I bought my 2015 Fiat pop on a whim I didn't need the car I had a Dodge Journey RT and loved it but honestly I wanted to see if my bank would allow me to have a second car they did! So I bought my Fiat 500 pop automatic in the color coffee brown. Now personally I wish I got the abarth I'm not sure why I didn't test drive it prior to my purchase but what's done is done. My pop is cute it's practical I average 29.6 mpg with tires low tire pressure light on to 34 mpg with good road and weather conditions. My best mpg for around town mixed with freeway was 39mpg! That was done after I washed my car and engine bay. So mpg is reasonable gas cost for me $20-24 depending where I go to fill up. Yes that is all I pay at the pumps for a full tank of gas! :) after 1 year of owning the car I started to lose a hubcap so I took them all off and saved them. Car looks better without hub caps :) size of the car is awesome! I can fit in any parking spot I can get in and out of traffic with ease people let me merge into lanes because my car is so small and most other fiat drivers are super nice! I do any repairs myself minus oil changes I pay for full synthetic and it cost me around $100 every 5000 miles. Charlie Brown my car has not given me any issues since I purchased it brand new in November of 2014. I have about 19k miles on it. I always feel safe driving it sure I can't beat my fianc?es VW golf TDI off the line but Charlie always gets me where I need to go and never lets me down. So what I don't like about the car is the cup holders! They annoy me I can't get to large cups from McDonald's to sit perfectly next to each other. :( I feel the layout of the cup holders could have been better thought out the sun visors or a bit short and don't always block out the sun but adjust your seat to a higher level and it works out ok. The arm rest my pop only came with one! Um... Yea there is a fix to this an aftermarket arm rest that can be installed but you lose your cup holders in the back part of the car doing this. One cool and safe feature is if it's raining and your backing up your rear window wiper automatically starts to clear the back window allowing you to see where your going! Smart thinking Fiat! I have programmed all my doors to unlock with just one touch of the Key FOB. Radio works great the car heater and ax works superb! Seeing that the car is so small it doesn't Take much to cool or heat up. So in closing I have a love hate relationship with my car more love than hate would I buy the car again? Heck yes! It's cheap to own easy to fix although nothing has broken yet for me I have installed a few extra gadgets for the car like hydraulic support arms for my hood. Replacement engines cost about a grand sometimes less. I plan to own this car till the frame falls apart lol I'll replace the engines when the time comes. I think for what it's worth this is a great first car collage bound car for your child good for retired people not to family friendly due to size but if you had to you could. I'll give this car an 8/10 for overall satisfaction! Thanks for reading don't let the little things like cup holders get to you just work with it every car has its flaw. Take care of your car and it will take care of you.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,15/02/2016,Q1 2015,0.9992,5,The appearance means a lot to me also as it is highly unique and does not have the cookie cutter design that most cars have.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,05/03/2016,Q1 2015,0,5,I noticed that it stands just a few inches short of my 2003 Chevy Venture van.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,28/03/2016,Q1 2015,0,5," The 500 turbo - slotting in between the non-turbo models on the low-end and more powerful turbo Abarth model on the high end is definitely a bit of a ""goldilocks"" fit for people interested in commuting. This is my second FIAT purchased new and I'm generally pretty pleased with the car. My one modification is the exhaust system like that of the Abarth - a loud open exhaust. This car will turn heads because of the sound - in a good way (it doesn't sound like a fart-can Civic from Fast and the Furious but more like the sensational Alfa Romeo 4C). In any case this car is a competent handler once you get used to the high-riding seats. It's easy to drive in stop-and-go traffic with simple hydraulic clutch that has nice progressive engagement and a snappy five-speed stick with fairly close ratios. If you're nice this is a car easily capable of beating it's EPA ratings especially on the freeway where I've seen averages approach 45mpg. And even if you're naughty you're still going to struggle to do worse than 25mpg city which is great fuel economy for a turbocharged car with a close-ratio gearbox being driven inefficiently. With the seats folded you're going to be able to carry plenty of groceries and even with them up you can fit luggage for two on a weekend getaway. Yes the newer Fiats can stream audio over bluetooth and have infotainment stuff but that's not the point of this car. What this thing is is simple: it's the cheapest performance-oriented turbo car for sale in the US and it's a real driver's car. Your money is buying not just the 240000rpm turbo which pushes 15-18psi of boost but you're getting a forged crankshaft and pistons with oil sprayers to keep those pistons cool. You get twin intercoolers an upgraded transmission and the most notable thing - upgraded brakes (bigger rotors performance pads). The brakes are among the grabbiest and firmest you'll find in anything for sale for less than $40000. They are probably the best brakes period on a car that stickers for < $20k. All of this makes for a compelling little car that wants you to be happy and have fun. If you look at a grey Yaris or silver Fit and think that cars like that are a punishment this is the car you want. It's a pitbull puppy that wants to tear the face off of your coworker's Fiesta. It wants you to take the backroads and have a laugh. It doesn't take itself too seriously and reminds you to live life and have fun. Now a final word about these cars: in the same way that they're not boring Honda Motor Corp or Toyota Motor Corp products in the ways mentioned above they are very Italian in one other way - they need a little TLC. Mine has had a few little things (power window motor needing adjustment bluetooth software issues) dealt with under warranty. If you look at other reviews people seem to lose their cool about this stuff which is unfortunate because it can happen with any car. Especially if you decide to buy a turbo car (any turbo car not just a Fiat) be aware that maintenance matters a lot more as does paying attention to things like fluids. Turbo cars like the Fiat may use a little oil (consume not leak)  between oil changes - it's a good idea to keep an eye on it. The sticky Pirelli tires that come on this car from the factory aren't going to last 50000 miles like the crappy eco tires on the Yaris. But if you love cars and are willing to spend a little extra effort and patience loving this one it's get to to 50000 smiles guaranteed.",,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,13/02/2017,Q1 2015,0.9986,5, I purchased a used low mileage 2015 Fiat 500e a couple of months ago and was so impressed with how it handles that I purchased another for my sister.  These cars are a real steal on the used car market.  I live in South Florida where it is warm and flat and generally have been getting over 100 miles of range (EPA 87).  A Fiat 500 in general is not the most practical car but if you want something really fun to drive this is it.   This car handles very similar to my former Mini Cooper but without the gas.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,20/02/2017,Q1 2015,0.7674,5, I recommend this car to anyone that is looking for a car that feels like it came from the distant future of the automotive industry. We purchased a used Fiat 500e and we are very happy with it. We test drove about 8 Fiat 500e at different dealerships until we found one that we liked. We studied the car and read many reviews before making the choice to buy the car. The battery is the most expensive part of the car and Fiat provides an 8 year or 100000 mile warranty on the battery.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,29/03/2017,Q1 2015,0.8955,5,The visibility is amazing! With large windows all around and front pillar split by glass and wraparound rear windows. I also own a VW Touareg and honestly have better visibility in this Fiat.  Features like the rear backup camera rear park assist system and  hands-free phone connectivity add to safety and convenience. The 17-inch wheels hold the road well even when driving on the freeway in rain. ,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,06/06/2015,Q2 2015,0.9485,4.375,Yes I was concerned with the professional ratings and reviews but my experience has been all positive. I have not experienced  the brake fade some reviewers did.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,29/06/2015,Q2 2015,0.775,5, I was looking at another car in the used car section of the Fiat dealer. I liked the way the Fiat looked so decided to give it a drive. Turned out I really liked this cute little car. So bought it that day. Red with automatic transmission. I can see where some of the interior parts will likely not hold up well but for the money and styling I think it's a great deal. I don't really drive a lot anymore and this is really perfect for me. Comfortable peppy and fun to look at. ,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,07/04/2016,Q2 2015,0.9795,5, This is the 11th new car I have purchased and this is one of the most enjoyable. My 2015 500L is a pleasure to drive. This vehicle has received  more than a few negative professional reviews  but I strongly disagree. Yes the center armrest is narrow but it is functional. I do not mind the emergency brake handle location. The car provides a great view of the road and the seating position is excellent. The ride is tuned to a good level in my opinion. I live in Chicago and this car has proven to be easy to park in tight city street spaces while providing excellent interior volume. Great cargo space for those larger purchases. Highway performance is also good I have averaged 33 mpg.  My children love this car and prefer to ride in it vs our Ford Motor Corp Taurus. ,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,20/04/2016,Q2 2015,0.994,5,It's a quick car and still has decent acceleration at 60+ mph. It handles and grips well is a lot of fun as a daily driver well at least when there isn't too much traffic.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,02/05/2016,Q2 2015,0.7579,5, Having owned a fiat 128 Sedan Fiat 128 3P Fiat Bravo and Fiat Spyder 2000 and loved them all I thought I would give Fiat another try since my wife has had a trouble free 500 Sport since 2012 with no problems.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,18/05/2016,Q2 2015,0.1531,4,I experienced a clutch pressure plate failure at only 255 miles. However roadside assistance is included for free with the purchase of a new FIAT so I got it home on my own and got it towed to the dealership for free and got the clutch replaced for free in-warranty. While that was of course disappointing I was provided with a nice FIAT 500 Sport loaner car for free that was fun to drive and now that the clutch is fixed there have been no further issues and the car has been very reliable. While that was a rather concerning start to get off to I now feel very safe that this car is reliable enough to take anywhere. I wish they offered the diesel here but the gas engine is nice.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,20/05/2016,Q2 2015,0.8967,5, I rented one a year or so ago for an 800+ trip. I really liked how it handled and the gas mileage was awesome. So I saved up and bought my own.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,20/05/2016,Q2 2015,0.883,1,All in all for the price I paid I feel very satisfied with my new car and must admit I enjoy the compliments from those who notice it in the bright yellow and black combination. The gloss black instrument panel bezels are a beautiful upgrade included in the Urbana Trekking Collection 1.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,04/06/2016,Q2 2015,0.9485,5, I've had my Abarth about 6 weeks now.  I park in a crowded parking lot at work as far as I can tell its the only one on the lot.  It stands out.  Mine is red with the upgraded $500 sixteen inch wheels.  The best feature of this car is its compelling value and its unbeatable fun factor.  I was originally shopping for the Sport which I test drove and loved probably should have bought for the gas mileage alone and almost equally cool in appearance and appeal as the Abarth.  But I loved the Abarth too particularly the exhaust badging and leather seats.  Keep in mind the exhaust is great exhaust porn to the extreme great at drive thru's and underpasses will put a smile on you face every day best described as a friendly companion and not at all intrusive.  Its absolutely fab!  If I'm careful I can average around 35 MPG on a tank with 60% of that a suburban commute to work.  I keep it out of sport mode for the most part just to save on fuel.  The Beats audio system is good very good but I can't imagine the base system also not being very good.  I did not do the comparison before I purchased.  Seems all the 500s I was interested in had the Beats so I just went with it.  Also no backup camera but it does have the backup warning feature a $250 option that I feel is very useful and well worth it.  Driving this car with the stick is easy and fun.  I think it's is the only way to go because of the gain in MPG and the fun factor.  Also the fit and finish is perfect.  I examined it with a magnifying glass no paint blemishes of any kind no gaps in the panels or doors (as compared to my 2005 Maxima purchased new a Nissan Motor Corp embarrassment for which I will never give them a second chance.  Shame shame shame on Nissan Motor Corp).  The ride quality is also great no rattles at all a little bouncy because of the small wheel base but an able and compliant suspension as well as a handling marvel.  Road noise is minimal this is a small car from the outside but doesn't sound like it from the inside.  I test drove a Honda Motor Corp Fit didn't like it but was willing to buy based alone on Honda Motor Corp reliability.  The front suspension gave the impression of the wheels trying to come thru the wheel wells let alone the road noise.  This car may be reliable and have great reviews but I don't see why.  It's a cheap car with a cheap price that will make you feel cheap as long as you own it.  Also the dealer played the online bait and switch despite having the online quote in their very hands.  This happened at two dealerships within a week.  Done with arrogant Honda Motor Corp... forever!  Thank you Honda Motor Corp for being rotten I think I've gotten a better car for a better price.  Also the electronics are all that.  Perhaps all new cars now come with sophisticated electronics but please be aware this was an inexpensive car where the fun price and appearance are its strengths.  The electronics are a bonus that bring it up to the standards of much more expensive cars.  Also the interior and electronics are intuitive and easy to use.  This is no accident it is well thought out design.  It's not just a lot of features thrown together haphazardly like my Maxima for bragging rights.  This is a comfortable car in many many respects.  The high roof line allows for more space then can be imagined.  This car does not feel cramped and you sit up high its easy in and easy out which gives great comfort to my aching right hip.  I also looked at the new Civic.  A great car if you don't mind spending north of $27K for the one you want with the wheels you want and you have to do the limbo to get into the darn thing for the privilege of nearly sitting on the ground.  Its great once you're in but you may need 911 to get out.  My hip and checkbook feel the Fiat is not just the better car its the smarter car too... and better looking.   I can't say enough about how great a value I feel this car is.  Also this is a specialty car and the dealer lots are full of unsold Abarths.  Most people I think will fall for the 500 but the real car people of which there are fewer will look to the Abarth with an appreciation of how different and special this car really is.  Consequently huge and disproportionate discounts are to be had.  My car listed for $27495 (no sunroof no navigation) final price $22295.  I think I overpaid and could have done better by about $2000 without even asking had I used some online tools.  But I don't feel bad about the purchase.  I liked the dealer patient and kind easy and nice.  The follow up has been nothing less then remarkable.  I feel like I've joined the family and a special community.  The dealer followed up and FIAT themselves too after receiving several welcome gifts.  Any problems call and a person will answer who is able to give answers.  I will remember this as a pleasant experience it the car proves itself as reasonably durable which I think it will then I'll stick with FIAT.  They have put a priceless smile on my face.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,30/06/2016,Q2 2015,0.9996,5, I bought a 500L Trekking I'm 2014. After half a year of smooth sailing a crazy person ran a red light and almost killed me. I had four surgeries. The car saves my life. The frame held up despite the awful crash. Now I bought a new leftover 2015 600L Easy. I missed this car so much. I'm glad to be alive and happy to be on the road with this dependable and absolutely adorable car!!,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,16/05/2017,Q2 2015,0.9095,3, Blind spots! Get to know you blind spots.  Sluggish acceleration.  Top heavy. Love the size the look and so far the reliability.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,31/08/2014,Q3 2015,-0.3382,4.75," I've owned four 500s since the model was introduced in 2012. Started with a Pop went to an Abarth then to a Sport and am back in the fold with a new 2015 Sport. Subtle refinements to the 2015 are much appreciated especially the new electronic instrument cluster. I have owned way too many cars but I think the Fiat may be my favorite all around vehicle. FUN to drive wonderful design inside and out frugal with fuel easy to maneuver and park great driving position and sight lines. Get the Sport model engage the ""sport"" button and enjoy one of the best kept secrets in the new car market.",,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,28/07/2015,Q3 2015,0.992,5, I've had this for around 8-10 months so I can't really say much on long term reliability but its a fun little car.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,31/08/2015,Q3 2015,0.6652,5, Really do not understand the negative press reviews for this car.  This is my second FIAT trading up from the 500 to the 500L.  I've come to the conclusion that people in this country reject things that are different or unique.  The design of the 500L is ingenious - for its size it has amazing interior volume.  The ride is very comfortable and it has a great seating position sitting higher than many crossovers.  I'm not sure why the press reviews say the car is under-powered. The engine is turbocharged and - at least in mine - when I hit the pedal that car MOVES!  It handles quite well and is fun to drive even for as tall as it is.  Most reviewers have highly criticized the looks of the 500L but I have only gotten nice compliments on it.  With all those windows the high seating position and spotter mirrors on both sides all around visibility is amazing!  FIAT has some quirky features and design elements but I think they make the car all that more appealing.  Some of the interior trim could be nicer but most cars today are filled with hard plastics - most of the hard plastic surfaces are slightly textured so I don't think they look cheap.  I have almost 20000 miles on mine and aside from routine maintenance the only issue I've had was with a rattle in the back (fixed by the dealer on the first visit).  FIAT stands behind their products with an impressive 4 year/50000 mile warranty too.  On one hand it is a shame this car doesn't sell better but I have never been one to drive what everyone else is driving so I like driving what I consider to be the best keep secret out there!  I would absolutely but another one without any hesitation.  Do yourself a favor - ignore the press critics and focus on the reviews of people who drive these cars day in and day out.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,31/07/2016,Q3 2015,0.9893,5,"No parking aids on my but then again whats the point. just aiming it in the general direction is good enough. It's small enough where i can just go ""Eh good enough"" and it is.",,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,20/08/2016,Q3 2015,0.7964,5,This is a nice car that is truly afFord Motor Corpable and accessible to all with unique features that make it fun to drive but also practical. Driving it also feels quite safe considering what a small car it is and that is a very important quality if you have children. Even though it doesn't have 4 doors I can fit my daughter's rear-facing car seat into it without too much trouble by simply sliding the driver's seat forward to put her in and moving it back again after her carseat clicks into it's seatbelted base. With my wife in the passenger seat the carseat clicked into place and 40 MPG we don't have to be stuck at home not going anywhere on weekends held hostage by gas prices anymore.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,31/07/2017,Q3 2015,0.9389,1, This car is cheaply made.

Fiat Motor Corp,2015,14/10/2015,Q4 2015,-0.8749,5,I traded in my luxury ride Buick Century for a 500L and I am in love with it. It has plenty enough power to get you on the interstate and cruise at the traditional 5 mph above the speed limit as well as get you in and out of tight spots. I especially love the option of running the gears yourself with the optional 6 speed automatic.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,20/10/2015,Q4 2015,0.8885,5, Great commuter car also a total blast to city drive.  Regenerative brakes are sweet and seem better than conventional great acceleration amazing that they make vehicles like this.  The only real downside I noted (aside from a limited range) is that going uphill really drains the batteries fast shortening the range.  That aside it is really roomy in the front the back clearly not popular with most.  You buy the EV that suits your needs- as we were looking at a commuter car this was by far the best choice.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2015,22/10/2015,Q4 2015,0.9722,3, PROS:  This car is really nimble in the city.  We live in San Francisco so parking is rarely a problem for this car.  This car is great at stop and go.  Often you can drive more than 100 miles in the city.  It has good handling and is fairly comfortable in the front seat.  CONS:  My worst complaint is the highway mileage.  If driving around 65 mph continuously don't expect the range to go beyond 60-70 miles.  Also when you turn on AC you lose about 10 (estimated) miles in range so be careful.  Back seat is horrible in terms of space.  Trunk space is small but for a family of three it's big enough to hold our weekend groceries.  I like the interior design but the quality of material is really cheap so I don't think it's worth the price tag.  Everyone was laughing at the bright orange but this bright color is necessary because sometimes on the road people just don't see this compact car.  Reliability and safety are unknown at this point since I am not a pro.  Overall I'd recommend this car for short distance commuters.,,,,

Fiat Motor Corp,2015,14/11/2015,Q4 2015,0,5," I had been waiting for the 2016 models to come out but I found the body on the 2015 500L Trekking model to be a far more attractive and more Italian look. I ended up buying the 2015 500L Trekking with the ""Beats"" sound system with SiriusXM satellite radio AISIN Heavy Duty 6-speed automatic transmission and U-connect touch screen. I use it for driving around San Francisco with all the hills and find it handles well. I love the headlights that move to follow your turns and curves. It is very easy to fold down the rear seats and create a spacious flat cargo area. The back seats also have the ability to recline to an almost flat bed like seat. The dual climate control keeps the front seat passengers happy and as the driver I enjoy the comfort of Power driver 4-way Lumbar Adjust. ",,,,

Fiat Motor Corp,2015,15/12/2016,Q4 2015,0.7774,5, I bought my Fiat 1 year ago. I love the little car! But Fiat is not customer friendly. On 8/27/2015 my engine blew with 28000 on the car. It took over a month to get it repaired and back to me. Three days later I gave it back to the dealer as it was not fixed. The 2nd engine blew. 3 months later they gave me my car back. The upper management will not contact me. They continue to tell a CSR my options. 1/3 of my ownership has been in the shop and they don't care. Buyers look elsewhere if you want support. My case number is 28015096.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2016,15/02/2016,Q1 2016,0.5478,5, For the first time ever I had to give a car a name. Meet Donatella who sat in the showroom with the shiny white and chrome finish the huge sunroof open to let the light show off the tobacco leather interior and then the moves of the effortless 2.5L and taught starring and ride sold me. However that same day in a quad-fecta of Midtown Manhattan I drove and bargained for the Q3 X1 Countryman 500X and then before buying the next day I threw in the ringer of the HR-V. Over some tense deliberations at Dunkin Donughts the spouse and I agreed to throw out logic and get the Fiat. Yes we've been back to the dealer for squeaky breaks and a blown fuse for the locks  but Fiat of Manhattan has been nothing but professional and accomodating with walk-in Saturday service. I've enjoyed nice lunches in Midtown and walks in Central Park and I knew very well that except for the HR-V we'd see the dealer again.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2016,29/02/2016,Q1 2016,0.9272,5, I purchased this car for my wife's daily use.  She loves it.  We have owned it for 6 months and have had zero problems.

Overall a good blend of styling and technology.,,,,

Fiat Motor Corp,2016,01/02/2017,Q1 2016,-0.5065,5, The new 2017 500C Pop is the same as the 2016 500C Easy.  I ended up purchasing the 2016 Easy because there was one in a color I liked at the closest dealership.  This model is an extremely afFord Motor Corpable way to have a convertible manual transmission cruise control great climate control and bluetooth (U connect is super user friendly I've never had a vehicle with bluetooth and started using it the day I bought the car).  I have enjoyed shifting gears in my 500C IMMENSELY and I'm sure the experience is similar in the 2017 Pop.  I honestly don't miss all the extras the lounge offers because I'm not a fan of leather seats (freezing in the winter when I leave for work around 6:20 A.M.).  I also love the simple knobs for A/C and heat as well as the interior air filter etc.  The design of the interior is simple and intuitive.  Plus the 500C offers the best of both world in practicality and owning a convertible.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2016,27/04/2016,Q2 2016,0.9892,5, My Fiat 500x has been named Bambino.  Awesome drive great shifting acceleration (especially sport mode).  I wish they had put a/c vents in the rear and a spare tire.  But beyond that the faux leather is amazing the sound system is great the gas mileage is so-so but you'll love this vehicle.  The trunk is split so you have reserved space the rear seats are roomy (I have three kids back there everyday).  We sold our Sienna for this vehicle and NO REGRETS.  It never feels like its dying during acceleration and its terribly unique and adorable.  The sun roofs are lovely and the technology is perfect (USB AUX SATELLITE- no cd). I've read reviews where they say the car feels like it can't find the right gear that is total nonsense the moment you own your vehicle you figure out the gears and how they feel 9 speed-it does what it's supposed too.  I tried MANY brands (for months) before taking Bambino and I almost bought another vehicle.  I feel blessed I tried Fiat.  After two test drives the same day...I was sold! Definitely an underdog.  Deserves hand washes and premium.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2016,28/04/2016,Q2 2016,0.9716,1, DO NOT BUY THE FIAT 500e!!  There is a major design flaw that will cost you $2000 at least once and likely $2000 / year.  This is NOT covered by the warranty.  Before buying one take a look at the plug (where the gas cap would normally be).  It is very fragile plastic.  Now think that for 8 hours or more a day this will be plugged into a charger with a handle slightly smaller than a gas pump handle.  Now think that if a small child bumps that even once the plastic connector will snap.  That simple looking connector costs almost $2000 to replace.  It is part of a cable bundle that runs to the front of the car.  It takes 7 hours to replace (at least that's what they bill).  This will break!!  Beware before buying this car!!  Warranty will not cover it because they say it is the child's fault for bumping into it not a car problem.,,,,

Fiat Motor Corp,2016,20/06/2016,Q2 2016,-0.5927,5, Great little car for short distance commute and travel. Has plenty of space in the backseat even though trunk space is limited. Charging is easy but know that on standard 110V outlet it would take an entire day to charge up. 24V commercial chargers can do the same in 4 hours or you can install a 240V at home. Love the styling and it's a hoot to drive. Instant torque and no shifting makes the car feel like it has way more power than it does. No problem at all passing cars with easy and it handles very well. Slightly wobbly on highway with high wind. One of the best EV out there that drives handles and performance as good with any gasoline vehicle - 500E is better than any other 500 variant including the Abarth IMO.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2016,04/04/2017,Q2 2016,0.9785,4," Here's the thing--there are a lot of cars with more room better build quality more cache better reliability and more room. There are cars that have way more updated electronics navigation etc. and are more functional in terms of rear seat space ergonomics and the like. None of them will be more fun than this car. None of them will make you smile laugh look forward to driving them talk to people about them or write a review. The Abarth (mine is a 2016 automatic in yellow) puts fun first and functionality second but don't take that to mean it's a toy or not a good everyday car. The automatic is a hoot (I own three other stick shift cars including a Porsche 911 in NYC) and blips the throttle with a roarty exhaust backfire when you get on the brakes. It pulls hard in point-and-squirt traffic when in ""Sport"" mode (the only mode you should be in) and hugs off-ramps like velcro to wool. It's fun. No one looks twice at your Mini Cooper S or your GTI. I catch people looking at this yellow bee all the time. The amazing thing is how good the ride is. Short wheelbase and stiff springs don't add up to comfort but on the highway and terrible pavement those dual-mode shocks work their magic and it is amazing. Seriously. Front seat space is good visibility is great (a by-product of the high seating position) and when you fold the rear seats down (or delete them) it's like the world's smallest SUV. It's as much car as you want but no more car than you need 94% of the time. Can humans fit in the back? Better than you think...but it's tight. Can I park anywhere? Yes. Do what I did--find a used one with less than 5K miles on it with a full factory warranty let someone else take the depreciation hit and drive off into the sunset. Does the exhaust sound better than a Ferrari? Yes. Is it fast? Not really no. Does it know it? No. It's like the chihuahua who thinks it's a Pit Bull but it's tongue-in-cheek. It's fun. It's probably just what you need.",,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2016,25/04/2017,Q2 2016,0.9924,5,Update:  Our Fiat continues to perform flawlessly.  I love how it drives very nimble and oh so practical.  Still no reliability problems.   Back for routine service (oil changes) only.   Remain puzzled by the continued poor reviews of this car.  I would encourage you to at least look at it and test drive if you are in the market for a small cross-over.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2016,11/06/2017,Q2 2016,0.0865,5, Amazing peppiness road handling and comfort.  Unbelievable financing.    I drove a 2013 for 3 years on lease and the dealership gave me such a good deal on a 2017 that I drove it out of the dealership the day I returned my 2013.  The range and mpg-e are better than reported by the EPA.  The 2013 had only one recall and that was a software upgrade.  I have been building and driving EVs for 25 years and this is the best ever excluding Tesla.  Tesla is the best car in the world.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2016,28/06/2017,Q2 2016,0.9694,5, I've been a fan Fiats for years mainly because I always thought they were just so cute. When it came around to buying a new car I was more inclined to Fiat because the bang-for-the-buck factor- I tell people that constantly and it's one of the reasons I recommend Fiat so much. How many brand new cars can you get for less than $20k taxes and fees included? Not many. One of my favorite things about my 2016 Fiat 500 Easy is the turning radius. The smaller size of the car combined with the tight-turning ability allows me to make a U-turn in the tightest of spaces with ease. It's zippier than I thought it would be too! I decided against the Sport and Abarth because I don't personally need the extra power (that and it might be tempting) but the acceleration is just fine and SO MUCH FUN. Another one of my favorite features is the space inside- I recently went on a 6-hour road trip with a passenger dog 1 luggage and a dog bed and we all fit wonderfully. Just fold the back seats down and bam you basically have a mini SUV. I'm still surprised at how well this car handles in snow and rain. It's not GREAT in snow but I was pleasantly surprised for how well it did in 2-5 inches. In rain it's fine however I do find going over the large unavoidable puddle to be terrifying because this car is small and light. However it feels good to drive- what I mean is although the car itself feels light in snow and rain it is SOLID. Whether you're driving or in the backseat Fiat's feel like quality vehicles to be in. The interior is beautiful with the houndstooth fabric seats comfortable high quality and durable. Sure the backseat isn't the greatest for comfort as the seats are slightly firm but it's better than you'd think. It's quiet gets great gas mileage and is a smooth ride. My only negatives are that in cold weather it takes a long time to warm up and the blindspot when looking over your shoulder at odd angled intersections is bad. Overall the style the drive price comfort/interior make me love this car so much. I highly recommend.,,,,

Fiat Motor Corp,2016,07/07/2016,Q3 2016,0,5, The 500e has a better response than the gas-powered version.  It handles better has the best pickup and go and is so fun to drive.  I wanted to lease an electric vehicle so I wouldn't have to pay for parking in my city's parking meters and garages (my city has an incentive to lease/purchase EVs) especially as I work downtown and must pay to park.  It's a dream to drive and park and recharges when you break so it becomes a game to get as much mileage from a charge as possible.  So far I've had no problems with the car at all.  The lease is up the end of the year and I've become spoiled with having an EV; it's wonderful not to pay for gas oil or smog check!  I hope to continue with either leasing or owning another EV.  At least in California this is the way to go especially as the state has a pay back money incentive to own/lease an EV.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2016,13/07/2016,Q3 2016,0.9726,5,I liked the style of it  have been asked several times about it when getting gas and things.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2016,21/07/2016,Q3 2016,0.4215,5, I saw an ad on this car early last year and I immediately fell in love. First I was bummed because it wasn't going to be out for a few more months. Finally it came out.... Yay!! I took it out for a few test drives waited for some people to buy it and put out reviews which took forever and still there's hardly any out there. I was scared  because not too many reviews and the ones that were out there were not that good. I've always owned Honda Motor Corp's so I was hesitating test driving other vehicles. I tried the Honda Motor Corp HRV seemed very cheap to me. So I kept searching the inventory for my little fiat I wanted a white lounge model with black leather seats and a sunroof they had them within 50 miles of me but by the time I got more serious about finally going and getting it of course they didn't have any within 200 miles of me that had the sunroof... So mine doesn't have the sunroof but that's ok I was kind of worried about the mesh that's up there any ways because the sunlight comes in the car a little too much the lady I spoke to at one the dealer's said you could tint the sunroof but I also thought that the mesh will eventually deteriorate......Anyhow I got a fantastic deal on mine.... And I Love Love Love it!! I think I will name it Marshmallow My 20 year old daughter's idea. I've had my baby since February and I haven't had any real issues with it. The one thing is when you lock the doors with the button outside sometimes you have to press it a few times. The transmission is a little tetchy and not real quick off the line that's ok I guess Fewer tickets... I was worried it wouldn't get up hills very good but it does just fine.  The seats are super comfortable. And like another reviewer mentioned is the cool gas cap there isn't one yay! You just open the door and boom you stick the nozzle in and you can't just stick any thing in there either so you don't have to worry people will still your gas..... I was on the fence about this car (even though I really wanted it) I was worried because it's a Fiat and not a Honda Motor Corp but now everyday I go outside and see my little baby I'm so glad I got it.,,,,

I'm a star at the Whole Foods parking lot.

Fiat Motor Corp,2016,10/09/2016,Q3 2016,0.6369,4," Only had our 500X AWD for a month but it seems to handle the curves in the mountains of NC/TN very well. Also the AWD seems to handle the rain better than our FWD Corolla. Notice some reviews complain on the shifting my experience switch to ""sport"" when you know you need more responsive shifting. Works for us. Not really comfortable front seats but for a compact SUV I can live with it. Only real complaint is the factory navigation and trying to find an update for it online. Google maps very up to date but would like NAV to be updated so I can leave phone alone totally and use factory hands free. Look forward to this fall/winter to see how the AWD holds up.",,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2016,30/09/2016,Q3 2016,0.9428,5," I bought this car because 95% of my driving is short range for shopping post office etc. when I am not traveling out of the country for business.  Also - the dealer and government incentives made the lease price so low the car was essentially free - the lease is about the amount I paid for gas monthly.   I truly did not expect to fall in love with this little car!   It makes me smile every time I drive it.  It is amazingly quiet and solid and very quick.  You really need to watch your speed.  It brakes very well and also handles better than expected considering it has hundreds of pounds of batteries in the floor. Whenever someone new gets in the first thing they say is ""Wow - it's nice!  And it's roomier inside than I expected!""  It is usually just me and a dog or the two of us but we have had 4 people in the car to go a short way to dinner etc.   The fact that there is NO SOUND except the (excellent) radio turning on when you ""start"" it still takes some getting used to.  The seats are surprisingly comfortable considering that they are so small and thin.  Totally adequate for the car.  The sound system is better than my Acura's.  The NAV is a simple TomTom system but it works and it has nearby charging stations pre-programmed in.  The Bluetooth works perfectly as does the climate control system.  This little car really is well equipped with everything except a backup camera but the rear bumper is about 10"" behind the rear window so it isn't a  serious issue and it has the parking sensors anyway.    Yes there are a few little ergonomic issues about the car that frustrate me and the steering requires real attention on the freeway  but in general for what it is intended for this is what everyone should be driving around town.    I have owned around 50 cars and this will be the one that will be hardest to let go of.   GREAT WORK FIAT!  And thanks to Fiat of Glendale for making the purchase so easy.",,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2016,08/11/2015,Q4 2016,0.9925,1,All Wheel Drive at a good starting price (around $24K),,,,

Fiat Motor Corp,2016,06/10/2016,Q4 2016,0.7659,4," I like the way the car drives but dislike a lot of the interior features.  First off the performance is great and I've never had such a fun car to drive.  The acceleration sets you back in your seat and is instantaneous.   I don't mind the range as we kept our gas cars and 95% of our driving is local.  The charging has been fine with the standard 110 outlet and I don't see a need for the fast charger.  My 7 year old daughter fits in the rear seat without a problem but I'm happy the lease will be up in a few years as we'll run out of room as she grows.  As for the bad....Headroom is awful.  I'm 6'3"" and basically have to put my head into the sunroof area to drive.  Backing out of a driveway is difficult as the rear visibility is very poor.  I'm happy for the sensors.  Storage inside the car is also horrible.  The glove box interior is flat so all your stuff comes out when you open the door.  The cupholders are too close together for even 2 medium drinks.  There's nowhere to put a cell phone.  I hate the radio.  There's a navigation warning that comes on for a while that prevents you from changing the channel...unless you take your eyes off the road and hit the ""accept"" button twice.  I don't need navigation as my cell phone does it better.  The Satellite Radio sounds compressed and worse than a cassette tape.  There's no CD player.  I love audio and honestly can't speak to the quality of the speakers since broadcast radio is the best quality thing I've listened to.  I hate that every statistic is listed in MPGe but we fill the car in kilowatts.  I find MPGe to be a worthless number.  One cool feature about the car is the smartphone app that allows me to turn on the climate control before I get to the car.  It's just tough that it only turns on the last setting you had.  If I drove with the air off and the windows down I have to remember to turn it back to automatic 68 degrees when I park if I want to use the app.    I also love/hate the App's function to show where the car is because it allows the person with whom you share the car with to spy on you.  I have nothing to hide but it gets weird when the other person knows where you went out for lunch.  The regenerative braking is cool but it doesn't seem to activate fully until the car is less than 90% charged.  i.e. It will regenerate up to -10kw but after 89% battery remaining it will go up to -40kw regeneration.  It almost pays not to fully charge the car if you don't need the range.    There's also a weird spot between 5mph and 0 where the brakes engage differently and grip strongly into a forceful stop.   Overall I like the car as a car but don't like the comfort features.  I'll miss it when the lease is up because it is such a unique experience.",,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2016,14/10/2016,Q4 2016,0.7719,5,I feel for the previous reviewers on here. I knew going into a new build from two manufacturers not know for reliability that there would be issues but that was the same for BMW/Mini and Audi. I read up on the USA 500xmweb forum and most known issues have bulletins on the faults. I randomly joined an Italian FB group and they go bonkers over the car but also have some similar issues. I don't need a daily driver and honestly if the dealer keeps it overnight for some time I'd just take the subway home and not have to worry about parking. I'd not recommend anything but a Honda Motor Corp/Mazda/Kia/Toyota Motor Corp as a daily driver but I've had those too over the years and frankly I'm really enjoying the sense of occasion I'm getting with the Fiat. I just really enjoy Donatella's company even when she's having an off day.,,,,

So far with a couple highway trips and a lot of downtown driving we are very hoppy with the car.

Fiat Motor Corp,2016,28/11/2016,Q4 2016,0.9386,5," I was looking for a car after a deer totaled my beloved Prius.  Because we're moving to the country and it's West Virginia an AWD was high on the list of must haves.  Went to the dealership intending to look at Imprezas.  When we got to the lot we saw the 2 Imprezas on my list and then noticed this little darling tucked in the corner with AWD on the windshield.  At first we both chuckled then walked up for a closer look.  It was pretty much love at first sight!  The car is charming both exterior and interior.  Got the keys got in and said ""Wow these seats are comfortable!""  Took it for a spin both in town and on the highway and was pleasantly surprised at how nimble it is to drive comfort was great and speed -- let's just say this car has pickup!!  It was so smooth on the highway my husband said ""honey you're going to have to watch your speed in this.""  Went back to the dealership to check out the Imprezas (since that's what we went for) sat in one and immediately got out.  Didn't even take it out of the parking spot.  Walked back in asked for the Fiat 500x Easy keys back and drove it home that day.  The drive home was 2 hours and I loved every minute of it.  My husband drove it all the next while we ran errands and said if he was in the market for a car he'd look for one for himself.  No it doesn't get the same gas milage as the Prius but Prius doesn't make an AWD and that was more important to me this time.  Bought it used 2016 10000 miles on it not one scratch or stain -- perfect contdition.  I love love love this car!!!!  Give it a try you won't regret it!!!!",,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2016,04/12/2016,Q4 2016,0.9942,4,For particulars I find the transmission unnoticeable for the most part. When I want to notice I'm rather impressed with the execution but do thing it's a little over the top for such a vehicle. The engine is smooth smooth smooth and pleanty powerful. Donatella does like to drink in the city at 19mpg but does take it easy on the N.J. Turnpike at 30mpg with cruise mostly set at 75 um 79mph. Uconnct works very well and so much easier than the BMW/Mini system as it shows as much love for my Android as it does for my Apple phones. The dog seems happy with the back seat. The sunroof is a huge favorite and the fixed glass part over the back seat opens that space up tremendously compared to all but the X1. ,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2016,22/12/2016,Q4 2016,0.9912,4, Spouse and I found ourselves in a rush and needing a rental car.  The only car immediately available was a Fiat 500 with automatic.  We took it.  On a 100 mile road trip to the event venue the car proved to be more than adequate to the task.  While acceleration was slow once at speed the car maintained interstate speeds without trouble.  We drove 80 and even 85mph passing many more powerful cars.  If you know how to drive a small engine this thing will do the job.  It was comfortable for two and luggage space was adequate for a long weekend trip.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2017,05/02/2017,Q1 2017,0.9002,5, I'm a little biased to the Fiat brand having owned a 128 Sport Coupe in the 70's and currently a 2012 500 Abarth. The 500x was something I wanted but had to do a little arm twisting to get my wife on board. We traded her Jeep Wrangler Sport in and I believe we were both happy to say goodbye to what was probably the most uncomfortable vehicle we've owned. We've sacrificed a little space moving into the 500x but aside from that we really love this vehicle. The ride is really comfortable handling is precise acceleration is adequate and it's a treat to drive. That's one thing about my Fiats that set them apart from all the other vehicles we've owned. Plain and simple they are fun to drive!,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2017,03/03/2017,Q1 2017,0.9766,5," I moved into the 500x Trekking AWD from my 2013 FIAT Abarth. I really really liked my Abarth but absolutely love my new 500x! I have some physical disabilities and the Abarth was while very fun to drive also hard for me to drive and was starting to find that people just do not see you in that small of a vehicle. Looking for comfort and size over the Abarth and the high quality of a precision Italian SUV boy did I find it! The new interior of the 500x Trekking is amazing and the technology in the features blew me away! It may take me a month to learn how to use everything this SUV has to offer. Styling is great and the optional 18"" wheel package and AWD I got adds even more tremendous styling. Acceleration is so so but then again I'm coming from the Abarth. Fuel economy is also not real fantastic but still pretty reasonable. Overall I have zero complaints on this SUV. The one serious recommendation I have though is get either the Trekking AWD or Lounge AWD model. I test drove the Pop and Easy FWD models and they do not even compare. All the bells and whistles with the two higher models are 100% worth it!",,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2017,16/03/2017,Q1 2017,0.9868,5," 2017 Fiat Spider 124 Abarth manual with brembo brake pkg.  It is such a joy to drive.  Handles fantastic beautiful interior beautiful looking car outside and inside. Love the hood and design of the car.  I owned a 95' 325I for about 9 years (very good car) and a 2006 330I for about 2 years.  The 330I cost a lot of money in repairs.  I wanted to purchase a 2014 Cayman S but the price of admission for a nicely optioned used one is about $50000.  I test drove the Fiat Spider and for $31700 brand new it was a no brainer.  Plus the Spider comes with 4 year 50000 warranty vs 3 year 36000 for the Miata.  I still would like to get a Cayman someday (but would like to keep the Spider as a second car) but for now I couldn't be happier with my decision.  I look forward to driving the car everyday.  I'm 6' 1"" and fit comfortably but it would be nice to have about 1 more inch of room so I could get the seat back a bit further ( I also wish the Cayman seat went back about one inch further).  That's why I gave it a 4 star out of 5 for comfort. I test drove the Fiat and then went and test drove the Miata the same day.  The Mazda Club with brembo brakes you can get for about $30000 and the Spider Abarth is about $31700 plus tax.  You can't go wrong with either car.  I believe the Mazda handles a little better and is a bit faster.  But for my everyday driving the Spider is just perfect.  It just came down to personal taste.  The clincher being Japanese build quality with Italian styling.  I like the alcantara seat fabric and the Recaro seats.  Plus the quad tail pipes.  They sound great in 1st and second gear but I wish they were louder as you go through the gears.  I love both cars but just liked the looks a little better of the Spider.  If you want wheel locks so some clown doesn't steel your wheels you can get them from the Mazda parts dept. for about $59 or order them online from Good-Win-Racing.com part ", 61-1057F for about $99.00.  After reading the comments about the goodwinracing wheel locks I opted for those.  Don't think you can go wrong either choice.  Happy motoring.  And do your self a huge favor regardless of what your wife or parents or friends say make sure you get the manual...  Shifting gears is half the fun of owning the car.,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2017,28/04/2017,Q2 2017,0.9972,5,Only caveat is that if you're more than 6' tall or over 200lbs definitely spend some extended time in one before committing to the purchase as it is a tight fit.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2017,09/05/2017,Q2 2017,0.6705,5, Makes going to the physical therapist - lower back - fun. Fortunately it comes with a walker :). Love the car. A kick to drive. Got the 6 speed. Comfortable. Handles very well. Grand children love it; kids are jealous. Wife who swore she wouldn't get in it when I drove on a highway has recanted and loves it too. Everything I had hoped for... and more.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2017,09/06/2017,Q2 2017,0.9711,5, I have been gagging for this car since Fiat/ Mazda bought it to my attention. It has taken me months to drill down and get the car I wanted. All I ever found on my search was automatics!!! ( I love driving and the thought of an automatic is just sacrilege in my opinion) Of course it had to be red and I opted for the luxury package which is totally worth it especially the LED lights and their capacity to light the road ahead at night. Just outstanding. Its GORGEOUS from every angle. Driving it is a pleasure. Love the torque and relaxed nature of the engine. Would prefer the exhaust a little louder (I have the 500 Abarth and its a mean sounding just beautiful chorus which is subdued in the 124) Was surprised Fiat didn't option it with the flat bottomed steering wheel that they have in the 500 which is a tactile pleasure but none the less it does feel good in the hands along with the shifter and short throws. Italian cars really do it for me they connect me emotionally which is lacking in other cars. Mazda and Fiat have done a wonderful job and I hope it pays big dividends for them.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2017,12/06/2017,Q2 2017,0.986,5, If your idea of performance is based on quarter mile times this isn't the car for you. If on the other hand carving through canyon or mountain roads is your thing there may not be anything else on sale at any price that can put as big a grin on your face as this Fiat. Its suspension is better sorted than the MX-5 (less roll less bumping up against the bump stops) and it has all the power you can realistically use on public roads. It also looks - to my eyes anyway - a more mature / elegant design than the Mazda. This is my third Fiat and - despite the reputation - I've never had a problem with any of them.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2017,13/06/2017,Q2 2017,0.9511,5, I've owned a couple of 2-seat roadsters...a 2004 Porsche Boxster and my 2017 Fiat 124 Spider Abarth.  The Boxster at close to $60000 was one of the best pure driver's cars I've ever driven.  That said for half the price of the Porsche I get 95% of the driving fun with my Abarth Spider.  I've had the car for about 6 months now...it was one of the first Abarths delivered in my area.  So far with almost 5000 miles on it it has been pure enjoyment.  Since neither my wife nor I are particularly large people we find the cockpit of the Abarth more than comfortable even on long rides.  The fit and finish is beautiful...ours is pearl white with the black leather interior...it turns heads wherever we go.  I've had many people ask what the car was and have gotten nothing but compliments from everyone.  I'm really glad we got the Abarth...the upgrades are worth it and make all the driving difference.  The Abarth's quad exhaust has a much nicer note than the Lusso or Classica.  Not that they are bad...just a bit quieter than I like.  The biggest difference is the Sport mode selector on the automatic transmission.  Since my wife opted for the auto the paddle shifters on the Abarth are a good compromise.  Also in Sport mode the shifts are much sharper and responsive.  Overall this car is a winner for us...great looking fun to drive and a great value for the money.  If you're in the market for a great 2-seat roadster give this one a long look...odds are you won't be disappointed!,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2017,19/06/2017,Q2 2017,0.9951,5, First off this car is 75 to 80% Mazda Miata. However the similarity ends there. The car has a longer nose and much better styling in my opinion.  The Fiat sounds and feels like a sports car.  The 6 speed auto is a Aisen product which gives the car the ability to shift even faster than a 6 speed manual.  To be fair the 6 speed auto is enough if you travel the daily freeway commute like me. While I have had the car for less than a week my sportscar past is not nill.  My father owned a 1988 Mazda RX7 convertible. While the RX7 could take a corner without effort  the Fiat still does the same but is a bit nose heavy. Why? The Fiat's engine is an iron block placing more weight over the front wheels.  Yet  the car takes the corners well.  I am still enjoying my commute even though I had to give up a Prius Plug-in that gets 50-60 mpg and a free ride in the CA HOV lane.  Who cares really when the Fiat is much more fun to drive and gets 31mpg on average.  It's your call but why waste money on a more expensive BMW or Mercedes when you can get an excellent roadster out of the Fiat 124 Spider Lusso.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2017,26/06/2017,Q2 2017,0.9775,5, I have owned over 65 vehicle in my lifetime and this 500X hits a sweet spot between form and function. It has that either love it or hate it styling ..which I love...the driving experience with the manual 6 speed and turbo 1.4 gives that sense of control and feel for the road that seems missing in most of the made for the masses CUV's out there...its refreshing to be engaged with the driving experience instead being a slave to the computer controlled automatic transmissions that make a mad dash for the highest ratio gearing no matter what speed you are driving. I guess I am one of the 4% ers that still like to row their own gears in this style of vehicle.                   The great part of this vehicle is that it has a 4 year/50K bumper to bumper warranty for a car that is priced with incentives at $15K .  Add to that fact that the car is well executed in its fit and finish with better quality materials than what would be found on higher grade trim levels from other manufacturers you can drive away from the dealership confident that you are not feeling car poor and still are driving a car that might arouse some envy from onlookers. ......time will tell if the thrill of commanding a fun to drive stylish CUV will fade but I suspect given the choice of driving my RAV4 limited or the 500X in my driveway I will grab the keys to the FIAT....she is just so much more fun!,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2017,04/08/2016,Q3 2017,0.9133,5, Such a drop-dead gorgeous car.  I was immediately won over by its styling.  Handling is impeccable and ample torque makes it really fun to drive.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2017,08/08/2016,Q3 2017,0.9061,5," Realizing that a two seat roadster isn't for everyone if you enjoy driving or would like to enjoy it and have the luxury of being able to get by with just two seats the FIAT 124 Spider is a great choice. Unless you just don't like driving the FIAT Spider is sure to put a smile on your face and make you want to take the long way to wherever you're going. This car isn't a super-powered muscle car but is light weight nimble peppy and handles superbly. While beauty is in the eye of the beholder for me this car is gorgeous. Many sports cars are known for their harsh ride - not the FIAT. While providing great sporting performance it also has a very comfortable and enjoyable ride with the top up or down. I'm 5'-8"" and the car fits me very well. I can imagine that someone over six-foot would feel a bit tight. I test drove both the automatic and the manual and concluded that while both are really great the manual provides an edge higher level of driver engagement and driving pleasure. But upon the insistence of my wife I purchased the auto. While I enjoyed the manual I'm very pleased with the auto. It's great cruising on the open road where you're not shifting a lot anyway and it's also less of a hassle in city traffic. I couldn't be more satisfied.",,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2017,05/09/2016,Q3 2017,0.9971,5," Until August 2 2016 I was ready to buy a 2017 Mercedes SLC300 via European delivery. Then I realized that I'd be paying $55K in advance for a car that wouldn't be in my home driveway for 6 months or more. Just to be sure I was making the right choice i googled ""2017 convertibles"" and suddenly saw a pic of a car I'd never seen before.  Having done a test drive in a Mercedes I was impressed with the quiet ride at 70mph on a freeway with top down. I was able to converse with the salesman at normal volume. One thing that totally UN-impressed me was that to start the newest Mercedes you MUST put a key in the ignition!  Within 48 hours of my Mercedes test drive I was cruising in a 2017 Fiat 124 Spider which seemed just as quiet on the highway and has push-button start. When I started comparing the overall specs of both cars the new body styling of the 124 Spider and at HALF the price of the Mercedes it became a VERY easy decision. As the former owner of 2 Porsche Lotus Esprit 3 Mercedes SL convertibles and a Rolls after a month driving my new 2017 Spider I am VERY happy with my choice!",,,,

Fiat Motor Corp,2017,30/11/2016,Q4 2017,0.4019,5, When looking for two seater drop top roadsters that capture the fun of driving a curvy technical back road for a low price you have a choice of a Miata (Mazda MX-5) or a ?. And Mazda does it well with a light weight quick well made and reliable car. But it's styling for me was like the rest of the car superbly functional.  All it needed was some passion to make it perfect and a little tuning by a culture with a rich road racing history.  Along comes Fiat to bring it both.  The beautiful throw back looks of the 124 Sport Abarth added to the MX-5 would have made a great car inspiring and the looks distinctive but it would still not be a Italian sports car but rather a better looking Mazda.  But Fiat ripped the heart out of the Miata by replacing its engine with the soul of an Italian. Now it has it own looks and the totally different driving experience that a turbo charged motor brings to a car.  But what about that tuning?  That is where the Abarth model's unique features come in .  The Bilstein shocks added to the front and rear revised roll stabilizers limited slip differential 17 inch wheels with 205 low profile tires the revised more throaty exhaust that adds four horsepower - combine to allow the engine suspension and even the steering to be dialed in with the sport mode button to transform the 124 from a gentleman's sporting vehicle into a superbly controlled feisty canyon carver expert that blows the top off the fun driving chart. This car feels like it is nailed to the pavement no matter the road surface or the severity of the curves.  Add the Brembo brake option as I did and you can bring down your boiling cup of espresso to a standstill in a heart beat. Put it all together as Fiat has and this is the most fun you can have for a $25 tank of gas that will take you 350 fun (did I mention it was fun?) filled miles..  I have only known her for 1000 miles so far but I can tell you already that if it were possible to marry this car I would.,,,,
Fiat Motor Corp,2017,10/12/2016,Q4 2017,0.9751,5," I purchased this Car November 19 2016. Its a base model Lusso with no real upgrades. I have had an extended highway trip and several day trips and I have fallen in love with this car. I owned an 85 Fiat Spider 2000 and I am partial to the Italian styling evident in the body design. Needless to say the performance over the 85 model cannot be compared. The 1.4l turbo accelerates on demand and shifts smoothly up and down. I am using the Asin auto transmission. The road handling and cornering are sharp and responsive. Even so its a smooth highway drive even on long trips. Its not the fastest 0-60 but it is quick. In my opinion the base sound system is adequate for all but the most serious audio enthusiasts. I stream Pandora thru my phone and the sound is terrific once adjusted for treble bass and balance. So my major positives are style and road handling. The only major drawbacks are leg room and trunk space. I am 6'1"" and I can fold my knees into a comfortable driving position but there is not enough room for my big feet. Strangely I have more than enough head room with the top up. If you have big feet there is limited room for the clutch hence my selection of the auto trans. Any over 6'2"" will have difficulty driving this car and they will not fit in the passenger seat due to the trim located where the glove box should be. There is very limited storage space inside the passenger compartment. The trunk has enough room for two small duffel bags and a computer bag. That's fine for my use as a weekender car. Price point for base Lusso is very attractive. In my opinion a lot of the extras in tech package are not necessary or worth the addt expense. Lastly when people see it they will think its a Miata or they ask what it is. Personally I do not think it looks that much like a Miata but there are not many on the road yet so its understandable for mistake. its a great car for those looking for a fun weekender.",,,,

Ford Motor Corp,1992,23/12/2003,Q4 1992,0.5935,4.5, I got a great deal on mine since my brother is a car salesman. I paid $1000 for it with only 63000 miles on it! Although the a/c never worked I love this car. Built like a tank. The only problems I experienced were an radiator leak electrical issues and a hole in the exhaust (regular wear). I had mechanic friends so repairs were cheap for me. I recently fell victim to 2 accidents in 2 months. Both times I was hit by senior men who shouldn't be driving. My car now has significant cosmetic damage and will cost more than it's worth to fix so I'm trading it in for a '94 Taurus GL sedan ::tear tear:: I would buy it again if given the opportunity!,,,,

No I'm not embelishing this story it's all true!! After finding out there was a safety recall on this car from Ford Motor Corp and the National Highway Safety Association. I contacted Ford Motor Corp and was told they would NOTY do anything to help me because of the age of the vehicle. I was also told not to contact them again. i know i only paid $100.00 for the car but I put plenty more into it which I was not able to recover via driving it. The car went to salvage with all the new parts i installed which i got $50.00 after towing.,,,,

My only real frustration is the rear brake drums becoming warped too early (replaced a couple of times). The 3.0l v6 will not out pace many newer 4cyl cars and the fuel milage is consistently 20 mpg city or highway despite tune up fuel/ air filter replacement. It has been pretty reliable except the starter and issues with rear drums. I picked it up cheap and in pristine condition yet I'm looking for another car. There are plenty of cars that match or even get better fuel mileage and perform better. It would make a great spare car.,,,,

Ford Motor Corp,2000,23/06/2013,Q2 2000,0.7901,4.25, My focus has been going strong for 184k miles which probably isn't the norm. It idles rough from an unbalanced engine.

Ford Motor Corp,2000,14/12/2011,Q4 2000,-0.79,3.875, I got the car about two years ago from my aunt who is possibly the worst car owner on the planet. The car was broken down barely running dirty everything was broken. I got my hands on it and about 1300 dollars later it was running good. The best part about this car is how fun it is to drive. I can take off faster than half of the cars my friends have. The car feels alive you can feel it. I just wish it was a little bit better quality. The interior is nice but cheap. You can tell. The outside is styled well but it's also made with some cheap-looking parts. It also feels like it won't be running so good in a few years. Who knows it might last me forever.,,,,

First winter the passenger side door lock froze. 6months into ownership of it the carpet came undone from under plastic door trim on both sides of car. Same issue with ""09"" too. 2 years in the trunk door latch is blown. We had to rig it so can open from pulling a rope threaded though the fold down back seat. Asked it to be repaired when had it in for service and idiots at shop failed to do anything to it. Haven't taken it back. 5yrs old now and back door on passenger side will not latch.

What's worse is the countless number of times we have to take it in to the dealer. They do not acknowledge the fact that this car should be considered a lemon. It has a foul smell coming from the ac/heater the brakes grind and pulsate when you apply pressure the interior has a constant rattling sound the front console latch broke off within one month of buying it the cheap plastic air vent covers fell off within 6 months of buying the vehicle and the transmission grinds jerks pops and seizes up often.

Within 6mnthswe had to take the car in to have the ""sync"" systems wiring harness replaced 4 times and the touch screen once! Within 16k miles (2 years) we had to replace the front rotors and brakes. And now just 11 months and 10k miles later we now need to replace the front rotors again the rear brakes and the rear rotors!

I love everything about it. Especally love the Sirius Satellite Radio. I can't go anywhere without listening to it. My mom and dad helped me buy it. It was a birthday gift. My dad was dead set against it. He kept bugging and nagging about how about a Hyundai Chevy Toyota Motor Corp ANYTHING BUT A Ford Motor Corp was his very words. Finally made him come out of his stubborn shell. We went to the dealership where it was we took a test drive and he never complained about it ever.

We like to travel and the ride and comfort in the Flex makes the trip enjoyable and relaxing.  Our family and friends have alot of precious memories spent together traveling in the Flex. We tell everyone how much we ""love"" our Flex and recommend it as a great car to purchase.  I can't wait for Ford Motor Corp to offer another 0% financing on the Flex so I can purchase a new one to enjoy.

Still gets great gas mileage. I average 34 mpg around town and 38 on the road. I've taken it all over the United states and keep up maintenance. The most I've done is replace gasket seals.,,,,
Ford Motor Corp,2009,26/12/2015,Q4 2009,0.9001,4, This is a great car for a first time driver or small family. I'm 20 years old and I needed to upgrade really bad. I was driving a 1993 cavalier. I didn't have a lot of money to spend and I wanted t dependable car. So after looking and looking I found a 2009 1 owner focus with 46k miles. This was just 9 months ago. I've already drove 16k miles! This is a great car. I do have the base model but that helped with the price.,,,,
Ford Motor Corp,2009,27/12/2015,Q4 2009,0.458,4, Overall this is a great car! My Ford Motor Corp focus is currently at 171000 miles and is still going strong. The only things we've had to replace so far is the tires battery spark plugs etc. Comfort is great in the front seats however if you have multiple people in your family or have a carpool you should know the back seat is VERY tight.. still comfortable just not designed for anyone tall.. The other complaint would be the fact that they offered lighter colors in the focus. I believe most all cars should either have black interior or VERY dark gray.. We got an awesome deal on the car because of how stained and gross the inside is.. floorboard carpet and cloth seating looks terrible.. even after I've used several stain removers..,,,,

Ford Motor Corp,2010,13/02/2012,Q1 2010,-0.2828,4.375, I have a 2010 Flex with ecoboost and have very few complaints about our vehicle thus far. It's pretty good on fuel (when you don't put your foot in it which is almost never) it's an extremely comfortable and versatile car and did I mention it has ecoboost? I'm not a huge fan of the marketing speak Ford Motor Corp used to describe this twin turbo direct injection engine but this motor deserves every positive word said about it. I've done some light duty towing and the motor feels as though it is never straining. Passing power is where the powerplant shines. My only minor nits to pick would be a couple of trim pieces which have broken and a faulty O2 sensor which were both under warranty. ,,,,

Overall I like the vehicle the handling is respectable even at highway speeds and interior cargo space truly is impressive.  I've driven this vehicle in all weather conditions and at all times of day.  While I am overall impressed with the vehicle however it does have a glaring safety concern.  The standard side view mirrors are inadequate for the vehicle. It desperately needs the full sized mirrors found on larger vans. Even looking over your right shoulder to check the blind spot it is possible to hide a mid-sized car in the Transits blind spot.,,,,

Ford Motor Corp,2010,24/07/2010,Q3 2010,-0.4201,4.125, We use our transit connect for work. My number 1 concern is the lack of leg room for back seat passengers.

It's amazing what it swallows. I just finished hauling 27 fully loaded 18 gallon totes in one load. I'm sure I was pushing the hauling weight capacity but it worked perfectly. When it's empty it rides like a washboard but it hauls cargo with the best. I've had zero mechanical problems and the divers side is comfortable for a full day's work.

One main issue so far is the Fuel Filler. The cap-less design is easily damaged and then you can't get fuel in your vehicle it keeps shutting the pump off. I live in NJ where you can't pump your own gas so I cant control how they do it.

The eco boost is awesome. It gets up and goes when you hit the peddle. Great for long hauls and short hauls. Highway and back roads with all the curves.

I purchased an extend warranty but that didn't cover it burned out headlight assembly that actually showed it burned which might have been a problem if it caught fire.  I leased it and later decided to purchase it boy was I upside down.

Ford Motor Corp,2015,18/02/2017,Q1 2015,-0.6808,5, Have had the C-Max for 18 months now.  Its been a great ride very fun quick and feels great to drive.  A very good job from Ford Motor Corp everything feels great and such a good job of automating the car where lights wipers and everything is automatic.  The car is very well executed although CVT it feels right and  has good acceleration.   Power and handling both are good up to 90 MPH and above that this is not so fun making it better suited for  City and traffic particularly great electric only ride in heavy traffic with out turning on  the engine at all  up  to 85 MPH.  Being in LA have just done 20000 miles and looking forward to many more.  This is no prius the higher seating weight and drive feel more like a cross between a mini minivan and a hot hatchback (which is very heavy at almost 4000 pounds).   My best tank MPG was about 85 MPG almost 1100 miles a 12 gallon tank and least has been around 65 MPG.   I am due for a second oil change shortly making it 10000 interval for maintenance which is always a good bonus.  Not much I would fault the car for maybe a bit higher ride and ground clearance be good but I do like the ride.  I got the plug in but the hybrid only ones were more fun much lighter and sharper rides.   I do have passengers often and the back  seat is very comfortable.  Ford Motor Corp has a winning formula for the car of the future size power and the whole package.,,,,
Ford Motor Corp,2015,06/09/2015,Q3 2015,0.9933,4, Original review from 2015: I was in the market for a plug in hybrid vehicle so choices were limited to the Prius the Volt and the C-Max.  I test drove all 3 and my favorite was the C-Max.  I chose it over the Prius because it was more fun to drive and had more built-in technology such as the navigation entertainment center bluetooth voice commands park assist hands-free tailgate opening.  The Volt had better acceleration  was low to the ground and had a sports car feel.  Being a family guy I opted for the C-Max which had a SUV-like look and feel (it is higher off the ground and had better visibility of the road).  It is my first Ford Motor Corp car and it is fun to drive.  I have been averaging 70mpg on a 50 mile commute to work. I work in Los Angeles and have found many places that supply the 220v outlets so I plug in while at work.,,,,
Ford Motor Corp,2015,14/07/2016,Q3 2015,0.9503,4, The energi version is the one we bought as the higher price was offset by the government tax rebate - thus the upgrade was free.  However this is our run-around-town car so the limited trunk space wasn't a problem.  If space is essential stay with the hybrid version.  Our car will go about 18-20 miles on the battery only just depends on the time of year.,,,,
Ford Motor Corp,2015,12/08/2016,Q3 2015,0.5235,5, I have owned over 35 vehicles in my life. Cars trucks and everything in between including a Nissan Motor Corp Leaf. This is without a doubt the best vehicle I have had so far. Great interior and comfort. Great stereo system. Room for 4 tall adults easily. Fantastic visibility. Great power and handling. Fantastic gas mileage. I average between 58mpg and 65mpg on my daily drive to work and back. My only complaint is the huge battery takes up most of the cargo area and for the price of this vehicle it should have a backup camera included but it does have backup sensors. This is a fantastic vehicle and I do not understand why Ford Motor Corp does no advertising on it. I hope they are not going to phase it out because that would be a huge mistake.,,,,
Ford Motor Corp,2015,24/09/2016,Q3 2015,0.9519,5," I've been scratching my head for the last year (that's how long I've owned my C-Max Energi) as to why Ford Motor Corp doesn't market this car (the regular Hybrid and the plug-in) against the hot-seGM Motor Corpent ""subcompact SUV's"" where it is essentially the same size (though different styling) and is cost-competitive (with the continuous incentives) while being so much better in so many ways - quieter much better passing/merging power much better mileage higher-quality interior better visibility etc...My spouse has the Subaru XV Crosstrek one of the more popular subcompact SUV's and while it's a nice car that we like my C-Max Energi is better in almost every respect even though I paid thousands less (after tax credit and incentives) than my spouse paid. Other than the lack of all-wheel drive (which I don't care about) and the XV Crosstrek's higher ground clearance the Subaru has essentially no advantages even though it costs more. By the way the exterior dimensions of the two cars are within about an inch or so on length/width/height and my perception is that the C-Max has a higher ride-height for the driver than the Crosstrek though that may just be my perception.",,,,

Ford Motor Corp,2015,19/12/2015,Q4 2015,0.4404,5,I think only marketing the car as a Prius alternative (when they market it at all) has severely hurt the C-Max sales since the C-Max will clearly not win purely on MPG; but it is such a better car in every other way that it's a shame they don't do more to broaden the appeal/category. Even letting it be pegged as a hatch-back/wagon hurts it since it really could fit into a few different categories (my view).,,,,

I had recently rented a 2015 Focus sedan and was surprisingly impressed by it's ""big car"" characteristics. I have never owned a Ford Motor Corp automobile. Since Honda Motor Corp didn't have a replacement Si available I went to test drive a basic 5spd Focus hatchback. Looking around the lot I was impressed from the window view of the ST interior. I had not researched that car and didn't know what I was in for after asking for a test drive. Not surprisingly the salesman offered no resistance...",,,,
Ford Motor Corp,2016,06/02/2016,Q1 2016,0.8934,5,"The Focus ST is a niche car.  It is aimed (noticed how I didn't say focused  ;-)   ) at someone who wants a fun and exciting car that is also practical and afFord Motor Corpable.  I don't believe everything I read especially in advertising but this car delivers.  I am surprised at how well it delivers.  The acceleration is quick the steering is quick and the braking is quick.  There are 5 other cars and a pickup in my driveway but there is only one car you would chose if you said to yourself ""I just feel like going out for a drive"".   There is great power delivery even down low and when the turbo kicks in you feel it push you back in the seat.  Gearbox is smooth.  You can row back and forth through the six gears if you want but the powerband is broad enough that downshifts are not nearly as necessary as some manuals I have owned.  The tires and suspension let you feel all the road imperfections but it is not harsh and handling always feels connected instead of busy or mushy.  Torque steer?  It is there if you push it in first or second.  Not hard to control but can be surprising when the car decides it doesn't want to accelerate in a straight line like you expected.  Overall the car is reasonably quiet.  You do hear the  engine 'power symposer' when you accelerate but not even loud enough to drown out a normal conversation.  I have yet to hear the turbo whistle at all.  Didn't get the Recaro seats.  The base seats fit me much better.  My ST1 has the base Ford Motor Corp Sync so I can't comment on Sync 3 either.   Although this is my daily driver in no way is it just an average commuter car.  It is for people who enjoy cars and want something that involves them in driving.  Choosing an ST is a personal statement. I think it is a mistake by Ford Motor Corp to offer it only in the ST1/2/3 packages.  I would have liked to pick and chose exactly which options fit me.  A marketing decision I am sure.   ",,,,
Ford Motor Corp,2016,05/04/2016,Q2 2016,0.9871,4,I don't challenge Mustangs Camaros and Chargers at the stop lights.  I don't wait to ambush BMW's and Vettes on twisty roads.  I don't look for 2 miles of straight road where I can wind it out (but I do admit on ramps have become lots of fun all of a sudden).  There are bigger cars and faster cars and smoother cars and easier cars to drive.  My ST is an every day driver that puts a smile on my face.  It knew it was what I wanted as soon as I drove it.,,,,
Ford Motor Corp,2016,17/06/2016,Q2 2016,0.835,5, This is my second Flex I traded in my 2009 for a 2016. It is the best family mover. My husband's Ford Motor Corp Explorer doesn't have nearly the space or flexibility as my Flex. I can haul 6 kids and all their stuff. The cargo area is deep so you have a lot more space than some other cars. It has great leg and head room even in the third row. The third row sits up like stadium seating so it is less claustrophobic. My SEL has a 120V plug and well as many charger locations which is definitely needed. The sync system works very well.

Ford Motor Corp,2016,29/06/2016,Q2 2016,0.9633,1, I have always loved Ford Motor Corp. We have owned an Expedition 2 different F150 F250 and now the Brand new 2016 Flex. I will never again buy a Ford Motor Corp. I have been broken down 5 times in the first 6000 miles. The car suddenly losses the ability to accelerate very unsafe. First time it happened I tried restarting the car but it didn't help. I had Ford Motor Corp roadside tow the car to the nearest dealer. I was told by that dealer they see it has a code the throttle body was the problem. But when they test drove the next day it accelerated fine. Which ment they wouldn't be allowed to fix it by Ford Motor Corp motor company unless it continues to happen. I called the dealer we bought it from. They were very kind and said they would order the new throttle body and to keep driving the car. I was told it would be best for the warranty if it continues to happen. Well today my car broke down 4 times!! After the 3rd power loss I tried to have it towed to the dealer that already had a part on order. However I was told it had to go to the nearest Ford Motor Corp. I was so upset I hung up and decided to try to make it home to have my husband follow me to the dealer we were already working with. I was driving past the nearest Ford Motor Corp on my way home. So I stopped and explained the problem and that I felt unsafe driving. I was told they couldn't take the car for repair if another dealer already ordered parts they also said they were not able to help me get it to the other dealer maybe 20 min away. I was told to drive it on back roads and that it shouldn't keep happening. Well I tried but when it broke down during rush hour for the fourth time only a few miles down the road. I had the car towed to the dealer that had ordered the parts. No new car with 6000 miles should break down 5 times! No car company should the car must to go to the nearest dealer and when it gets there refuse service. Parts are back ordered for weeks but I won't be driving that car. It is an accident waiting to happen. Shame on Ford Motor Corp!! It also has problems with the suspension it will be getting looked at for that for a third time! They can hear the problem with the suspension but can't find it. I hate my flex. Worst car I have ever owned. Horrible service from manufacturer. We had isseus with past cars but Ford Motor Corp was always amazing and took care of any problems. Not sure what has happened to Ford Motor Corp but I won't be buying another Ford Motor Corp. And I hope their lemon doesn't cause my family to get in an accident! Buyer be ware!!!,,,,

The fit and finish of the interior is excellent very easy on the eyes and full of discovery. I'm 6'1"" 210lbs and find the seats fit like a glove.

Ford Motor Corp,2016,09/07/2016,Q3 2016,0.9751,2," This review is based on renting the car for 5 days.   They took a decent comfortable sedan and tried to stuff it full of annoying electronic features that do annoying things at inexplicable times.   It was always beeping and shrieking for no apparent reason.   Never did figure it out.  The displays are confusing and too bright.  The ""keyless"" key was equally annoying.  You didn't have to put it into a switch so you toss it somewhere but you still have to dig it out to lock the car which winds up being as much or more trouble.   It did move along comfortably as one would expect of an American big car [big by today's standards anyway.]  The trunk was nice and roomy.  The seats seemed to be leather so maybe it was an SEL I don't know.  The cabin temperature was always too hot or too cold and someone thought it was a good idea for any change to the settings to take place over 5-10 seconds to confuse people further.

Ford Motor Corp,2017,23/01/2017,Q1 2017,-0.296,5, I test drove the Chevy Camaro Dodge Challenger and Nissan Motor Corp 370Z.  All the listed had advantages and disadvantages. Also read several magazine articles/reviews which favored the Mustang as a daily driver and then took the Mustang for a few more test drives and for me the Ford Motor Corp Mustang 5.0 GT Premium black on black with blacked out emblems and automatic transmission won hands down.  All around a more driver friendly car but definitely still plenty of muscle for the road to include back roads.  Felt more comfortable for the longer drives and the fit and finish to include a nicely appointed interior definitely sold me to the Ford Motor Corp.  I don't consider myself a Ford Motor Corp guy but after driving the Mustang I decided I had to own one.  To date I've driven it to the NYC area and it was very comfortable for three hours each way and very soon to Daytona to attend the Rolex 24.  I've only owned it since late December 2016 so there are a number of areas on this survey I can't yet speak to...but I'm definitely hoping they are just as strong in the positive as my experience so far.,,,,
Ford Motor Corp,2017,23/01/2017,Q1 2017,0.9943,5," I bought this car in December of '16 after a wait of over 2 years. This is my third Mustang i have owned in the last 35 years. This car has really matured since my old '86 gt I had years ago. The car is larger and drives larger than both my '86 and my '02 GT I had to sell before buying this Mustang yet it far out handles both of them (my 02 GT had about 4k in aftermarket upgrades in both engine mods and suspension).  The only real complaint about the car is the ingress and egress for me. I am 6'4"" and you have to be fairly flexible to get in and out. Once you are in though the car fits like a glove the shifter falling right into place the steering wheel can be adjusted to taste and everything is very simple to use. The standard leather seats are outstanding and after taking a 6-1/2 hour trip up to Napa from So. Cal the seats gave my wife and I plenty of support and the heating and cooling feature is great! As for the performance...my mustang is plenty quick but I don't drive it to be a drag racer. I wanted a true GT. The handling is more than adequate with the performance package and the six piston Brembos are superlative. There is a reason why Mustangs have been around for over 50 years. Ford Motor Corp has obviously found a formula of performance comfort and style and blend it together in a fashion that other American car manufacturers try to emulate but always come up short in one or more of these categories missing the mark on Ford Motor Corp's pony car and what it represents.",,,,
Ford Motor Corp,2017,13/03/2017,Q1 2017,0.9336,5, Handles and drives like a much lighter and smaller car.  Is the first car I have owned where the factory left me nothing to do aftermarket.  As pleased as I have ever been with a car purchase.  Dispite the highish price it is great value for what you get.  It would cost more to mod a mustang GT (also a very good platform) to get it to the level of ths car as a stock package.,,,,
Ford Motor Corp,2017,22/03/2017,Q1 2017,0.9511,2,Original review starts here:  I loved my 2014 Mustang convertible (read the review) so I got a new 2017 to have all of the active safety features and other convenience tech. What I got was something that is a huge step up in quality.  In fact a different machine with the feel of the BMWs (Mustang handles better in my opinion - test them) I tested and a huge leap above a Camaro.  It accelerates smoothly up to 121 mph (where it is electronically limited) gets up to 32 mpg on highway (with super unleaded about 29-30 with regular).  Handles much better than the GT (again try them out side by side - I did several times - GT feels front heavy and bulky). Drives like a sports car. Has plenty of storage something lacking in the old Mustang and non-existent in Camaros.  The only things lacking is automatic braking (something I will demand in 3 years or I will switch models) and lane warning/assist.  The forward collision warning is great but it just pre-loads brakes probably a nod to the general macho among Mustang owners but auto braking should be an option for those of us more concerned with being alive (and the safety of others) than imagined macho.  Another after market add on is a windscreen which really makes a difference.  It makes your car a two seater when in place but I never have more than one lady friend at a time riding! :)  Easy to remove but don't get this car for a backseat anyway.  One small feature I love is the center console which locks when you hit the door lock fob.  I leave the top down a lot when I go into a store. This combined with alarms keeps stray hands out that stuff.  All in all a wonderful car.  If they add automatic braking I will be getting another in about 3 years.,,,,
Ford Motor Corp,2017,29/03/2017,Q1 2017,0.9934,5, Love the style comfort & smooth power & performance.,,,,
Ford Motor Corp,2017,02/04/2017,Q2 2017,0.7717,5, My wife and I got this car as a loaner for our regular car's recall replacement. I've never owned a performance auto but have been a long time motorcyclist and have owned several high performance 2-wheelers. This Mustang blows me away. The acceleration is awesome. I drove across a mountain range on a very twisty section of interstate and have to say that was the most fun I have ever had on 4 wheels. It was solidly planted the steering was very precise; I could easily change lines mid-curve; acceleration out of the curves was very controlled. With the top up it feels like an upscale touring car. With the top down it is simply sexy as h***. We're now planning to sell our SUV and buy a new Mustang. Life is short.,,,,
Ford Motor Corp,2017,27/04/2017,Q2 2017,0.9804,4, Check out your car very well before purchasing. It is obvious that Ford Motor Corp still does not care about quality after all of these years & why I avoided them for most of my life. The car I have is twisted. The driver's side door is warped. The hood is extremely hard to open because it barely opens far enough to get small fingers underneath to get to the release. The body lines do not line up. The dealership could do nothing about this and the repairs will require a body shop. I know this is a bad car that I bought but these things should have been caught by Ford Motor Corp before being released from the factory! It wasn't noticed by me until I got the car home & really went over it that evening. The dealer is doing it's best to get it fixed by getting it to the right people but it really should go back to Ford Motor Corp & I should get a replacement car. Other than the body/frame issues the car drives great handles great looks great and the front seats are comfortable. Can't say much for the back seat. The rear seats look great but are useless. A child couldn't even sit back there. St least the trunk is very roomy. I like the car but it will definitely be my last Ford Motor Corp.,,,,
Ford Motor Corp,2017,01/05/2017,Q2 2017,0.99,5, Had a Vette C-7 which was a great car until I drove this beast! Slightly less money for more options I am very impressed so far.,,,,

Ford Motor Corp,2017,06/05/2017,Q2 2017,0.5835,5, Wanted to own Mustang forever practicality and utility always won and I ended up with either a 4 door sedan or an SUV.  Life's too short to live with regrets so I made a decision and found my 2015 50th Anniversary Mustang in Wimbeldon white. The sound of that V8 is music to my ears and never fails to put a smile on my face. She gets washed 3-4 times a week and ois always lookng her best. Best decision I ever made!  Now only if the gas mileage could improve I wouldn't find myself at the gas station so often.,,,,

Ford Motor Corp,2017,09/05/2017,Q2 2017,0.6696,5," Since letting my 69 GTO go way back in 1983 I've missed having a little muscle under the hood. I've driven many cars since then mostly ""responsible"" types until my wife picked up a Porshe Boxter S a few years ago. The thrill of fast acceleration and road hugging turns on the local road track got me thinking about speed again but driving this car every day is a no way!  While fun it's just not a daily driver. I started considering trading in my latest Acura a few months ago or maybe just selling it outright and picking up an old late 60's or early 70's muscle car. After looking for a while I kept remembering that while my GTO was fun I worked on it as much as I drove it. Started looking at late model muscle cars Lexus Camero Corvette and then the Shelby GT350.  Everything about this car spoke quality and performance and driving it is just a true pleasure. I like it's interior far more than the other American competition and once you hear that Vodoo engine rev there's just nothing else like it! I do a lot of highway and while I miss my modern car lane assist this thing is so steady that you can take your hands off the wheel for at least as long as a car with lane assist in the straight sections of highway. Unlike what I'd of gained in an old muscle car lots of straight line power this thing also hugs the road like any European sports car. I had read about a few miner quality issues other buyers had experiences and I had the same lose pop in plastic rivets on some ground effects and a pin hole in on rear CV boot but the dealer made it all right in no time. I've never made an automobile purchase without some level of buyer's remorse until this one. I look forward to driving it every day and cannot wait to get her on both the drag strip and road course. I think it's only short coming might be off the line in the quarter mile where the relatively low torque of this engine and 3.73 gearing causes it to lug just a bit but it appears to makes up for it as soon as the R's get up past the 4000 mark and makes an impressive quarter mile in the 12 second range. Heck my GTO only did low 13's but it's low end torque would lift the front wheels off the ground and snap things left and right. I don't miss that! Of course she was slightly modified. Am I happy? Darn right I am. Thank you Ford Motor Corp and American ingenuity and thanks to the foreign competition that drove you to reinvent the muscle car!",,,,
Ford Motor Corp,2017,17/05/2017,Q2 2017,0.9899,5, Just purchased the Mustang V6 auto last week.  Impressive car.  I have owned 11 mustangs in the past and this is by far the most capable mustang yet.  The V6 has plenty of power and the transmission shifts at just the right times.  The independent rear suspension is great and provides an aggressive yet comfortable ride.  Although I haven't put too many miles on the car yet averaging 24.5 mpg with a 60/40 mix of in-town and freeway driving.  This is great.   The interior is very good with soft materials where you want them and the seats are very supportive and comfortable.  Impressive implementation of the instrumentation.  I am sad that this is the last year for the V6 as it is a great engine and is a fantastic performer.  I found the 4cyl loud under load and at times clumsy on the test drive and I feel Ford Motor Corp is making a big mistake removing the V6 from the engine lineup.   Overall I have a big smile on my face and am enjoying the ride.  I am looking forward to putting the mustang through its paces on a trip this summer on route 66.,,,,
Ford Motor Corp,2017,20/05/2017,Q2 2017,0.9899,5," My last 4 cars were Priuses my wife also drives a Prius.  her forst response when she drove my C-Max was ""WOW!""  I wanted a plug in but the Prius plug in wasn't available yet in my state so I took a look at the C-Max Energi.  SO GLAD I DID!  I LOVE THIS CAR!  It is better than the Prius in every possible way except possibly reliability which in the Prius is legendary the C-Max could be too just haven't had it long enough to know.  It is faster more quiet much more comfortable and the deal I got was unbelievable (especially when you include the $4500 refundable federal tax credit!).  I'm also getting more miles per charge than advertised as much as 28 miles.  You can charge it at home fully charges overnight with a regular outlet as best we can tell it cost about $20 per month in electricity and lucky for me I have fast chargers available to me for free at my work (fully charges in less than 3 hours).  I have a 54 mile round trip commute and only have to fill the tank about once every 3 to 4 weeks and am averaging 74 mpg so far.  i cannot recommend this car more highly!  Crazy thing is I never see any on the road?  Ford Motor Corp clearly isn't doing a good enough job marketing this car it blows the Prius away and I know what I'm talking about between my wife and me we've had seven never thought I'd by any other car.",,,,

Ford Motor Corp,2017,14/09/2016,Q3 2017,0.8767,4," Yes They do! finally a mustang for modern America.  With the new suspension in the rear this car drives! Instead of the old mustangs where going into a corner meant ending up at the coroner's this mustang lets you power through in control. Fun to drive with a stiff but yet forgiving ride.  Can't wait to take this to the track both the drag and the road track. This does not however mean it's all roses for the new mustang.  The interior leaves you wanting and thinking why? For example there are very few fake aluminum-plastic lookalike pieces 5 switches 2 accents and the cowling around each primary air vents. With so few of these items why not use real aluminum? It would have increased the cost by 60 bucks so it leaves me saying why? Secondly the GT coyote engine suffers from a lack of tech. Ford Motor Corp makes the all amazing Ford Motor Corp GT which has an engine that has the capability to turn off cylinders and has the red light ""stop start"" function these or at the very lest the ""stop start"" should be a must for this engine and would help massively with fuel eco.  That being said the noise the cayote engine makes and the power it produces is something that must be experienced to believe!",,,,
Ford Motor Corp,2017,16/09/2016,Q3 2017,0.9343,5, I just received my 2017 Mustang GT Premium that was ordered back in March.  I ordered it with the performance package premium leather and the 6 speed manual transmission.  This is my first Mustang that I have ordered and I do have to say the wait was longer then I expected.  When the car finally came in the dealer was excellent in getting it ready for me to pick up.  The interior is very nice and well thought out - the only down side is there is not a whole lot of room in the back seats.  That is about the only negative I can say about the interior.  I ordered the premium leather with the red accents and they are very comfortable and look GREAT!  The 5.0 Coyote is one strong motor.  It has all the power and go that you will need.  Very strong and very quick.  When you step on it it wakes up and you will be through the gears before you know it.  Very impressed.  All I can say Ford Motor Corp did a wonderful job on this car.  This is a true American Muscle Car.  It is built from the ground up to be a Mustang and no other chassis in the Ford Motor Corp line up shares any parts of it.  Great Muscle Car!!,,,,
Ford Motor Corp,2017,26/09/2016,Q3 2017,0.991,5, Make sure you fully understand the power of this new pony! The Shelby isn't just a regular GT Mustang- whole new world.  I went from a Nissan Motor Corp Z350 and knew right away that the GT350 was a beast that had to be tamed.  You can feel the power as soon as you turn the car on! Be safe- learn the car and have fun with that raw power.  Also did I mention that this pony corners as well as my old Z350 which I thought cornered very well! I was surprised since the mustang was never known to corner! They added independent rear wheel suspension! Only took them 50 years lol! So this pony can do it all now- drive to work and race on the track,,,,
Ford Motor Corp,2017,12/07/2017,Q3 2017,0.9242,3, I loved my 2011 so much when my son took it off to college I bought myself a 2017. Sadly the 2017 seems like a step backwards. The gas mileage is worse the plastic exterior parts are cheap and fragile (simple freeway stone blew a hole in the front another piece was broke by a simple shopping cart bump) the interior has terrible design errors (i.e. the seat bracing connecting back to bottom grinds into you when you exit the car (broke the cell phone in my back pocket) the plastic and cloth features scuff at every light touch and they glued felt on the seat belt buckle to solve a clacking noise where it banged against the center console. I would have easily given my 2011 5-stars... I struggle to give the 2017 more than 3 but it does have great engine power looks amazing and will hopefully be as reliable in the end as my 2011. Ford Motor Corp see what you can do about actually improving the model (features/performance) from year to year.,,,,

Ford Motor Corp,2017,28/10/2016,Q4 2017,0.9572,5, My overall rating would have been higher had the V8 engine been available with a shutdown feature at highway speeds to increase overall mileage. The Corvette has it. I bought the car 9/7 and put 10K miles on it by 3/1. It came with the 265/35/20 tires and they really hold the road. Replacements will be in  the close to $300 each range but they have a 500 wear rating and roll out smooth. The pre-settings on the driver power seat allows for easy exit and entrance. The interior is well done and high quality. The car is surprisingly quiet with top up or down. I bought the Mustang because I need as much trunk space as possible for my trips and unlike the hardtop convertibles the Mustang top folds onto itself with no intrusion into an almost full size trunk. The top goes up and down quietly and fast. I downgraded the Navigation system because there is no way to alphabetize your Favorites or eliminate previous destinations individually. There is a myriad of options in the gauges and lighting features. The engine data that is displayed is far beyond the average driver. The car is a bargain in today's market. Options included automatic with paddle shifters Nav system tire pkg upgraded interior 120000 mile warranty.,,,,
Ford Motor Corp,2017,18/12/2016,Q4 2017,0.9418,5, Update: I had to trade in this car on a new Honda Motor Corp CRV Touring.  I just could not get out of it any more. My joints were in rebellion so I am just too old (68) for this car with deep and low bucket seats.  In fact when I showed the CRV to my Aunt and Uncle they went and traded in their Lincoln Town Car on the exact same thing. My Aunt was able to get out with no effort at all with her bad knees. That is the ONLY problem I had with using the 2017 Mustang but it was enough.  It also depreciated heavily in 7 months from $42K to $24K KBB trade!  That part is disgusting but you get nothing for all the add-ons...beware!,,,,

GM Motor Corp,2000,01/03/2005,Q1 2000,0.5719,4.875, So far so good with this van. It is a big vehicle and sits high off the road. I have the 5.0 ltr motor which gives it decent power. A little noisy when you punch it to merge with fast traffic. Brakes are spongy but work when required. It is great if you have lots of kids. It seats 6 people very nicely. Very roomy and the heater is great. Good handling but tends to pull in high winds. It is a highway cruiser vehicle however it handles nicely in town. Gas mileage is great. I like it a lot. I am glad I bought it. GM Motor CorpC makes a good quality vehicle which is why I bought this make of van. I have not yet drove it in deep snow which will be the real test for handling. ,,,,

GM Motor Corp,2007,17/03/2015,Q1 2007,0,2.875," I am not usually one to write reviews on vehicles and I find it ironically funny that many people have the same complaints about their GM Motor CorpC Acadia that I do. I purchased this vehicle on a ""deal"" which I should have never done. Now looking back on it the 2007 was probably the worse year for this vehicle. I have already replaced my transmission the power steering has gone had to weld the exhaust twice and also had the rear-windshield washer hose leak all over the fuse box causing the entire vehicle to short out basically. So I laugh at people who write don't believe the reviews..... Well... you are wrong my friend. This vehicle should have been pulled off the market many times over!",,,,
GM Motor Corp,2007,18/11/2006,Q4 2007,0.3612,5, I looked at several different CUVs and SUVs and none had the interior refinement or power and economy as the Acadia. Great product.,,,,
GM Motor Corp,2007,13/01/2007,Q1 2007,0.4215,5, Just bought. You should go look at car if you have a growing family.The car has standard bucket seats(credit if you want bench) The third seat is removable and the middle row moves foward and back. Adults comfortable in 3rd row. The pricing is like shopping for a Honda Motor Corp. You do not have to pay for all those extra options.They have FD and AWD. It is decieving from the outside and roomy inside. I love it. I also know it is first year out but it has everything I want in a luxury car without the price. Great Job GM Motor CorpC on your crossover. So far good gas mileage . Have not truly broken in yet. Still under the 500 mark.,,,,
GM Motor Corp,2007,16/01/2007,Q1 2007,0.7681,5,Bucket seats. Children are older coming from surburban. Roomy. The design gas mileage good so far. The outside uses chrome and bigger tires.

I rated my truck a 10 in every category except for fuel economy. I get around 18mpg mixed with the 5.3L 4x4 extended cab but they said that after a few thousand miles it will improve. So far only 1700 miles. The ride is great and the remote start has come in handy in warming up the interior these last few weeks.  Engine power is good.  Transmission is smooth and responsive.

GM Motor Corp,2007,01/07/2007,Q3 2007,0,4.875," We just picked up our loaded GM Motor CorpC Acadia Friday night and are extremely happy. The vehicle is well built inside and out and is a pleasure to drive. Lots of bells and whistles to keep you occupied in your spare time. I'm 6'2"" and I have more than enough room. This vehicle drives so smoothly it feels like your driving 55 when you're really going 85(oops!). Handling is superior to other vehicles we've owned. It's a real head turner when your driving down the road. I saw numerous Envoy owners trying to catch up with us to get a peak. The Acadia will be a real winner for GM Motor CorpC. The motor has more than enough power to get up and go. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone. Watch out Soccer Moms!",,,,
GM Motor Corp,2007,24/09/2007,Q3 2007,0.9447,2.5,"The looks and the power.

GM Motor Corp,2007,15/03/2008,Q1 2007,0.1154,4.875, I just bought my truck a few days ago. I got the vortec max SLT. I was worried about such a big engine and fuel economy (6.0 liter) but when under moderate excelleration or on the highway it only uses 4 cylinders giving it better mileage than my mini-van that I traded in on it. It is very comfortable and the fit and finish of the leather and brushed aluminum trim competes with a Mercedes or BMW. The new design is way ahead of anything else I have seen on the road when people see it they can't help but notice it's size and intmidating looks. Yes I also got it because I have neer owned anything but a GM Motor Corp automobile but after driving it around I know I made the right choice.,,,,
GM Motor Corp,2007,17/10/2008,Q4 2007,0.4201,5, Good looks abound with chrome wheels ground effects package and special fade paint exterior with standard roof to enable city garage parking. Easy pop-out center captain seats and electric rear seat converts to queen bed. In this position with appropriate protection on leather upholstery it's a real work horse to haul 4 X 8 materials ladders etc. Excellent towing ability.  Best of all a real comfortable 7 person touring vehicle with ample luggage storage and 22 mpg.,,,,
GM Motor Corp,2007,24/08/2010,Q3 2007,0.9294,4.5,The dealership had a limited selection of extended cabs.  Maybe a crew cab with a longer bed would have been nice but they only come with the 5.5' bed for now so I got the extended cab with the 6.5' bed.  ,,,,

As soon as we saw it on the lot we were in love. Chrome accents against the black and white background made for a shapr looking vehicle. The ride is great and smooth.  Engine is plenty powerful. Interior is nicely refined and very quiet. Rear legroom is unrivaled by any other vehicle. Rear sliding seat gives an extra 4 inches if needed for back seat passenger. Not badly priced either.,,,,

GM Motor Corp,2007,29/03/2016,Q1 2007,0,5, I have a 2007 Acadia with 70000 miles on it. I am having major transmission problems. It slips all the time. Some times it will not go into gear. It is very dangerous when exiting onto a highway. In addition there is a cover that apparently does not cover the power steering fluid/belt? they did not fully explain this well. The issue is when it really rains the car does not steer. So I have ended up in a median and some other odd places. Luckily no one has been hurt... yet. I get endles repairs on this car.

This one wasn't even my 1st choice but I couldn't pass up the great deal I was getting and so far its been good. The handling is pretty good and fuel economy is what can be expected out of an AWD SUV. The vehicle comes with a lot of standard features(denali) like heated seats remote start etc. My only real problem is the 3rd row seat. Does not fold down to the ground and is made for children. Other models like the 2008 Toyota Motor Corp Sequoia and 2008 Lincoln Navigator can sit full grown adults back there and does fold down to the ground and other crossovers of GM Motor Corp do this so why not the full size SUVs.,,,,

GM Motor Corp,2008,11/02/2015,Q1 2008,0,2, GM Motor Corp discovered that many Acadias recieved a defective wave plate during assembly.  The wave plate is a component in the transmission.  Instead of recalling the Acadia and having the part replaced GM Motor CorpC offered a special warranty up to 120000 miles to reimburse the cost of transmission repairs.  Of course since I actually take care of my car and drive it gently my wave plate lasted until 121500 miles.  The transmission repair cost $2700.  The problem was a defective waveplate.  GM Motor CorpC did not provide any assistance with the repair costs despite the fact it was barely beyond the warranty.  I'm actually somewhat thankful though.  Now I have a good excuse to buy a foreign car.  For the past 20 years I have always owned domestic vehicles...mostly GM Motor Corp vehicles because I have felt proud of supporting the domestic auto makers.  But with this latest issue it is apparent that GM Motor Corp has no interest in supporting their customers.  Now if people give me a hard time about buying foreign I can refer to this experience and people will understand.  This will be the last GM Motor Corp product I own.  I was going to buy a new Yukon in the Spring.  That won't be happening now.,,,,

The engine light came on at the same time my engine started smoking and hesitating in rush hour traffic.  OnStar ran a diagnostic and reported the findings to me. I had it towed in to the dealer they wouldn't tell me the problem until I told them that OnStar had already made it known to me. Four days later I drove my Acadia back home and fumes were coming through the air vents. I took it back to the dealer. They said the other fuel injectors had stopped working.

I paid more for the Acadia than I would have for another Yukon (with the factory and dealer spiffs they were giving back then). Turns out my Yukon got BETTER mileage! The Acadia is O.K. looks good reliable etc but it is more like driving a van than an SUV. My only complaint is the acceleration hesitation in wet and cold weather which nobody can seem to fix. Other than that no problems at all in the first 20k miles. But next time around Im back to a Yukon.,,,,

At first I thought it was a nice car for the money and offered a lot of comforts and conveniences. After 20k miles it needed at timing chain. after 40k miles it needed another timing chain. Shortly after that the ac would cycle on off every 10 seconds. Took it to GM Motor CorpC for ac check and they said was ok. Took it back at least 8 times and they started changing parts and every time they touched it it got worse. Finally they told me it needed a new evaporator because it was leaking. So I took it to another shop for a 2nd opinion and they said they could not see or find any leaks. So back to GM Motor CorpC again and they started messing with the computer. Only to make it worse. Than Yesterday driving home I hear a growling noise coming from the tranny and than my car stoped and I had to get towed to GM Motor CorpC.

Although we have only driven it for 3 weeks now and have 1000 miles on it we can see it is everything we wanted/needed in our ""new wheels"".  Ride is fantastic gas mileage is close to the window sticker suggested mpg highway and city.  Has volumes of cargo space with rear seats reclined (although we still haven't gotten the knack for dropping the center bucket seats completely down).  Enjoy the heads-up display and navigation system. Rear backup camera a must! We have always owned GM Motor Corp products and so far this Acadia meets & beats our expectations.",,,,

The Acadia out-performed all these. Great interior space great features if you like the additional XM radio and ONstar services. No lag on the throttle... immediate response steady cornering and level steering. Superb traction control system; disengages acceleration when slipping on ice or when lack of traction stops engine RPM shootups. ABS system works great. It does weigh nearly 7000 lbs so braking is a bit more noticable at higher speeds (nose dive). After 5000+ miles I am averaging 16.3mpg / city and 20.2mpg hwy cruising at 70-75mph...23 or 24mpg as stated??? yeah right! Overall safety specs are sufficient; airbags all around great framework. well thought out interior heating and cooling system is loud enough to overpower a bluetooth phonecall when turned all the way up. remote start auto liftgate great features except when parked too close to something. bad side depth perception on back up cam. low road noise good stock tires (goodyear fortera comfort tread); bad for rain snow and ice... will hydroplane or loose traction at 45mph+ on standing water. upgrade tires to fortera triple tread (my opinion). steering wheel controls are oddly placed. front wipers on left stick rear wipers on center console below a/c system controls why? volume and radio controls in a good consolidated location on steering wheel. good location for cruise control buttons. three locations for liftgate operations (key on liftgate and next to rear wipers.. why?) auto dimming rear view mirror great black lower trim around Acadia difficult to clean need special cleaner from autoparts store. a little above average accessory selection great audio even without BOSE radio buttons can be confusing double vanity lighted shades dual exhaust great feature. battery location inconvenient (center of car between 2nd row captain seats) deep lubricated slide rails for 2nd row captain seats much debris can be lodged or stuck in there not good. inside material ""plastic"" poor choice of material easily scuffed marked up and just unsightly.

The first year was fine--the lack of technology was a nuisance but the car fit my very tall family so I was willing to overlook that.

I rented a Durango and Jeep for a couple of days. Both of them had driving positions that didnt allow me to read the gauges because the steering wheel blocked it. In the Jeep the A Pillar is way to wide & the roof line to low to be comfortable. With the rear seats down the Durangos load floor was so high that my dog was breathing down my neck and could be pitched out the side window.

I didn't want my SUV to look like a car. I like the power-liftgate off switch. If you own a dog or in a low garage/parking structure you will too! Besides I don't have the patience to wait for it to open/close nor risk my dog deciding he wants to escape when its going down. Drives really smooth and don't agree with edmunds review of it being bland to drive or hard to maneuver due to its size. I like the heft and substantial feel..doesn't feel like a car but its also not as clumsy or porky feeling as piloting a Yukon/Tahoe. Finally the 4 rear A/C vents are great!",,,,

GM Motor Corp,2012,20/12/2014,Q4 2012,0.8576,4.625,The interior is very plastic looking but not much different from the 2009 GM Motor CorpC Sierra Crew Cab pickup I had (fyi-the 2013 interior is revised). Its early but its a bit of a gas pig. However its a 2.5 ton vehicle w/AWD so I expected to pay more at the pump. The driver seat is way to soft..I have already built up the seat foam using a professional auto upholstery shop. The head rests are terrible and can hit some people in the neck/shoulders and having to have them shaved down as well. Its a shame GM Motor CorpC has ruined resale by using these as rental vehicles.

Overall the GM Motor CorpC Acadia is light years better with fit and finish and luxury touches though there are a handful of items that the Acadia lacks for $50k+ that should be corrected sooner than later. A digital speedometer and gauge is expected at this price point (appears to be limited to existing gauge cluster). So is keyless ignition and collision avoidance at least as an option. The other notable difference is realizing how good the Dodge's Mercedes based drivetrain is compared to the aging Lambda platform. The Acadia is heavy and took a little getting used to after coming out of the Dodge.,,,,

The Denali trim is much improved with panels being better integrated with the body less chrome and better options for 20"" wheels with machined alloys that support the GM Motor CorpC brand as advertised. Interior fit and finish with stitched dash and wood trim detail make for pleasing trips to the mall or a trip to the beach. The Acadia is large and can accommodate a large amount of gear.",,,,
GM Motor Corp,2013,10/05/2015,Q2 2013,0.34,4,The refresh has given this CUV what we consider a more truck like presence which appeals to both the male and female driver in our family.

GM Motor Corp,2017,22/10/2016,Q4 2017,0.5617,5, Loved my '08 Acadia and I felt no need to change horses when it came time for replacement. So far I have driven this only in good weather so I can't comment at all on rain/snow driving. This model seems noticeably quieter than my 08 and seems a bit more peppy. Driving is smooth I can't think of a thing to criticize in a major way but I have some  quibbles. The Infotainment system may have some improvements over my old system but it doesn't seem as intuitive. For one thing I can't figure out how to mark the location where I am sitting and if it's in the manual show me where!  The feature was drop-dead easy in my old Acadia. The manual by the way is poorly thought out and lacking detail. The electronics are great! Blind spot alert feature is very helpful and a must-have. Backup camera as well. Color we chose was Sparkling silver and it's gorgeous!,,,,
GM Motor Corp,2017,06/01/2017,Q1 2017,0.9323,5, I owned a 2014 Acadia Denali before but after purchasing the 2017 Acadia Limited I find it to be every bit as good if not better than it's predecessor.  The only thing I miss is the power tilt and telescope steering wheel. But the manually adjusted function in the 2017 Limited is easy to adjust and I'm sure it will not be any problem in the near future. The up grades to the 2017 Limited are really amazing. Wish they would have been available in the 2014 Denali but that is the difference in 3 years of technology upgrades. I prefer the size of the Limited  as opposed to the new smaller 2017 Acadia. My wife and I just purchased our new Limited in March and drove to St Louis and back to Vero Beach FL averaging 23 mpg. We are pleased!,,,,

Engine is phenomenal - never been repaired since we got it.  On top of that the engine still sounds like brand new very quiet.  Only bad experience with this car was when I had to push it from a freeway to an exit for a gas it was my fault though - I ran out of gas.

A year later it has 150 thousand miles and still runs strong.  it's fun sporty can carry heavy loads and has never broken down on me.  I had the oil changed at Walmart they never put new oil in it.  I ran it unwittingly for 2 months before I realized the problem and it's never suffered or seized.  My mother had a 1986 Honda Motor Corp Prelude spun it rolled it and still drove it home.  that car died out at 300 thousand miles!  they're easy to fix parts are easy to find and they are exceptionally cheap to maintain.  I've done most of the work on mine myself.,,,,

Honda Motor Corp,1991,10/09/2007,Q4 1991,0.0772,3.75, Bought this thing after it was beat on to crap. Very easy to fix up and modify. Great entry level auto-x ride. Wishbone suspension by far beats the econo macpherson setup of the newer gen.  Stock sohc engine is worthless but again easy to replace and swap out.  Prone to lots of rust with its age. Very little maintanence needed if it's just transportation that you need.  Very light with an engine swap and an adjustable suspension and you have yourself a good sporty car. Parts are interchangeable with integra's which adds to the availability of parts. A lot can be done to the car despite its age.  ,,,,

I have not owned it long but I am already wondering what I ever did with out it.  My first fuel cycle resulted in a MPG of 40.8 mostly highway.  That is a lot better than the 17.5 I was getting.

Honda Motor Corp,1992,14-09-2012,Q2 1992,0.296,4, I drove this car until it died. I got the car in 1998 and I got my 350 dollars out of it that I definitely owe Honda Motor Corp some money (Don't tell them that). The car currently has 298000 miles on it. They really don't make cars like that anymore. Sometimes it was really hard to start but always kept me safe. I drove this car from NY to PA TN IN GA SC FL CT OH to name a few places. I loved my car rust and all. The thing is the engine is still alive and kicking .Thing is the car will fall apart but the engine is really built to last. Its just water is coming in now and the alternator has finally died. Bottom line if I could get a semi new 1992 Honda Motor Corp Civic. I would buy it yesterday.,,,,

Honda Motor Corp,1992,21-06-2010,Q3 1992,0,4.75, I've been tempted to see the car trade it in for anything because the car lasts so long. I am the original owner when it first came out it was the first rounded edge small luxury car. Sure somethings needed replacement: 2 radiators 1 set cv boots 3 alternators 2 ignition coils. Every thing else I could replace myself. I solved the problem of wind noise 14 years later with a rubber band stuffed in the door rubber grommets to press it against the window better and to place some noise insulation underneath the floor and inside the front doors. Get a k & n air filter and pickup from stop is good enough. On the freeway given the light weight at high speed it can match any car from 70+,,,,

Honda Motor Corp,1992,28-11-2005,Q4 1992,-0.5704,4.5, I bought this car new in 1992 knowing almost nothing about Honda Motor Corp.  I got it because it had 92 hp instead of the paltry 70 the CX and DX had.  It also had cloth seats aluminum wheels and about 5 more mpg.  I planned to sell it when my 1969 Mustang came out of restoration shop but fell in love with the car.  I added the cargo cover cruise control intermittent wipers body side moldings floor mats rear speakers from an SI tinted windows factory clock the tall console with pad which is essential for a comfortable driving position  and AMFM CD with Sirius.  The car is easy to maintain gets about 43 city and 50 hwy.  On one trip to Iowa I filled up the 10 gallon tank in Austin TX and drove to El Dorado Kansas where I put 9.6 gallons in.  That averaged 57.7 mpg driving at 65 mph.  I have never gotten less than 42 mpg and that was in summer AC blasting in city traffic.  I just brought it in to have it rebuilt at 489k.  I will never sell this car.  I painted it once and the interior is still very good.  I wonder how many people have a one owner VX?   I just found out how many were made.,,,,

Very frugal on fuel and maintenance good brakes decent takeoff good steering and handling seats 4 w/comfort heating/cooling OK good trunk space. The bad: Engine started burning oil at 175K miles. I like mechanics so I did a partial rebuilt (piston rings were worn) and took care of things that mechanics could not (e.g. oil leaks). Cost: about $400 (parts+tools) Car has run great ever since; now at 205K miles gets 25-29mpg in only-city driving and 35-40mpg hwy. We got stranded only once when ignition coil died at 197k miles.

Honda Motor Corp,1993,03/11/2014,Q3 1993,0,4, I bought my Honda Motor Corp Civic Si in 97' for $6200. I have done some basic performance modifications on it but little to the engine itself. I have had nearly zero problems with this car. My distributor bearing went out in 2001 (cost me approx. $220 to fix myself) and then my ignition coil failed 5/06 (cost me less than $100 to fix myself). This car still gets about  38 mpg on the highway and about 34 mpg in the city. The mpg averages 36-37 even after hitting 260000 miles!! Yes 260000!!

Honda Motor Corp,1997,03/11/2010,Q1 1997,0.6249,4.5, I got this car for my 16th birthday three years ago with 88k miles and nearly 30k miles later it's still running great. Had to have the axle replaced a while back for a cost of $800 but that's really been the only problem I've had. Gas mileage is decent but could be a little better.

Honda Motor Corp,1997,18-03-2016,Q1 1997,0.0762,5, This was my first car. I bought it when I was 16 and kept for 9 years and simply needed a change. This is a car for anyone be it your first car a project car or a commuter car. By no means was the car fast but it took corners like it was on rails and it was very lively; especially compared to V6/V8 Toyota Motor Corp/Lexus that my parents own. My only grip was the placement of the cup holders. To access them you would have to open a flap which in turn covered the slot to the CD/tape player. Great car to blast around a track and the best part was I still got solid gas mileage regardless of how aggressively I drove. Very easy/cheap to repair own and soup up.

Honda Motor Corp,1997,14-01-2007,Q2 1997,0.9517,5, I bought this car as my first car from a private seller for $1400 with 146K on it only 3 months ago. When I first bought it it needed a new oil distributor and radiator. I replaced them both thinking I had gotten away with an awesome deal. Then one of my tires went flat spent a pretty penny on that too. Shortly after on a long trip to my favorite state park the transmission gives out in the middle of the road when I was almost at my destination.

We had just had a baby and I was driving a 2002 Mustang and needed something I felt would be safer. We had no major problems. The engine mounts had to be replaced and the transmission was beginning to act a little squirrelly. However my husband wrecked it before we were able to get the transmission checked out. He fell asleep behind the wheel on the way home from work (oil field) and went off into a steep ditch hitting a concrete embankment which caused the Pilot to roll twice landing upside down when finished. My husband was not buckled and ended up in the back by the cargo door. He WALKED away with NO INJURIES. Thank you Honda Motor Corp!,,,,

Honda Motor Corp,2004,01/01/2007,Q1 2004,0.604,5, My Honda Motor Corp pilot has never let me down it's good in the rain in the snow gets me were ever I have to go .  It's very comfortable and wants to cruise control is set on the open road I have to do very little except for stay awake and steer .  Honda Motor Corp has been very good at doing all the recalls and their service is excellent .,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2004,16-06-2010,Q1 2004,0.4404,3.75, Very happy with the pilot have owned it for 6 months we have had a strange noise coming from under the vehicle almost sounds like the cooling fans just take off at a very high speed and stop. And the suspension has a issue with hopping sometimes. Have brought back to the dealership 3 times and the truck won't make the noise nor will it act up at all. Thinking about asking for them to take the truck back if they can not find the problem. We really like this vehicle its a good solid SUV.,,,,

Honda Motor Corp,2004,16-08-2016,Q1 2004,0.9603,5,Car is underpowered for its size especially when fully loaded with passengers and/or cargo but we handle this aspect by just driving more conservatively. Fuel economy is not great but that's not unexpected for a full size SUV with 4x4 capacity. We really don't' have any complaints beyond this.

Honda Motor Corp,2004,29-04-2015,Q2 2004,0.9326,4.75, The car has a smooth ride and road noise is minimal on highway. We added a hitch and roof rack and with 6 adults and loaded with cargo the car handles quite nicely except that it is  underpowered especially if it's fully loaded. Acceleration and hill climbs are slower than I would like. This car has a lot of cargo space with room for car seats in 2nd and 3rd rows though access to 3rd row can be a bit challenging for an average adult. 3rd row is best for kids or small adults as legroom is limited. We are happy with this car. Great family or roadtrip vehicle.  It's held its value well and we will be holding on to it for a long time.,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2004,04/04/2016,Q2 2004,0.34,5, We love our Honda Motor Corp Pilot... We live in Colorado along the I25 corridor and this car is subjected daily to a miserable commute 60 miles daily in all kinds of weather and it has performed beautifully! We have nearly 209000 miles on it and have only had one issue with it the power steering was giving us some issues at about the ten year mark... Honda Motor Corp worked through it even called in the engineers that designed the car and figured out that it was a pinhole leak in the vacuum hose... Honda Motor Corp covered EVERYTHING and we didn't pay a dime... Wonderful support from the dealer and manufacturer!  The car has been driven across country a half dozen times and is so comfortable to drive on the long haul...  I hope to keep it for another ten years!  Just get the oil changed religiously and do the maintenance and Honda Motor Corps will last forever! My first Honda Motor Corp was a 1988 Civic with a manual transmission and I drove that for 250000 miles...,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2004,11/06/2006,Q3 2004,0,2, Researched and test drove the 2003 but waited for the 2004 in hope of Honda Motor Corp removing any bugs. At 19000 miles the radiator had to be replaced due to a split seam. At 20186 the ECT sensor was replaced. At 20300 the thermostat was replaced. At  22495 the fuel pump/filter assembly was replaced. At 23500 the PCM was replaced. The the fuel injectors were replaced during same service visit. The vehicle is in the dealership (not the one purchased from) having the head gaskets replaced. This is the seventh trip to the same dealership to repair the check engine light and VTM- 4 light on. We have the technology to put a man on the moon and safely return him but I can't get my car fixed.,,,,

Honda Motor Corp,2004,04/05/2016,Q3 2004,0.9678,5,We like the roominess for passengers and the cargo space available when 3rd row is down. 3rd row seating is nice and it even has cupholders and good visibility out of rear side windows.  Legroom in 3rd row is okay for small adults but 2nd row is quite comfortable for an 3 average or larger adults or 3 car seats. Car handles highway drives very well. Seats are comfortable for long trips and ride is smooth. Car has held up quite well over our 4 year ownership term. We also use it for camping trips and have had no issue with trekking over rocky muddy or dirty roads. Highly recommend!,,,,

Honda Motor Corp,2004,31-10-2010,Q4 2004,-0.6256,4.25, Bought new still running great at over 90K.  Comfortable and non-fatiguing--I've driven dozens of 1000+ mile trips in it most in 1 shot.  I love the storage space between the front seats--still haven't seen another SUV like it. Brakes started pulsing at 45K machining helps only temporarily. Cannot get EPA gas mileage.  I like at new SUVs and just don't see anything I'd like better so I'll just keep this one as long as it's reliable. ,,,,

At 19k miles we had to have the block replaced due to a cracked block being installed at the factory.  Now Honda Motor Corp America is giving us the run around on the warranty...beware!,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2005,15-04-2008,Q3 2005,-0.8858,5, Purchased this Honda Motor Corp because it carries up to 8 people we didn't want a bigger SUV.  The battery died in the first year while on a trip had to replace it.  The rear latch for the hatch has fallen off three times and I have had to screw it back on.  Makes a loud noise when driving at highway speed with windows down.  Now at 63000 miles we have a broken motor mount.  None of these items are serious but I expected more from Honda Motor Corp especially for the money we paid (we purchased the top model of the Pilot).  The gas mileage also isn't very good for a 6 cylinder.,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2005,20-08-2010,Q3 2005,-0.5707,4.875, Two areas of concern: poor sound system (need to fiddle fiddle fiddle with dials when switching from talk to music) and tailgate height when open. Other than those it is a strong value. Very capable in icy snowy conditions.  ,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2005,13-10-2010,Q3 2005,0.4404,1.5, The car is great. Except the All wheel drive maintenance!  I change the engine oil every 3K but the differential HAS to be changed every 5K  (6K).  This is pricey at every other oil change. Other than that I would probably buy another one in 12 years.  I also found and replaced the air filter with a cold air intake.  A little bit better gas mileage and bit better performance off the line.,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2005,14-10-2010,Q3 2005,0.6249,5, I've had my pilot for about 8 months now. Between work college and family I put many miles on my pilot and find it is still very reliable. Although it cost me more than I wanted to spend this car is truly a great investment. I bought it knowing that I will have a family someday and this vehicle will stand the test of time. Got into an accident a month after I bought it. Totaled half of the other vehicle. My pilot had nothing but a scratch on the bumper and I didn't even know I hit the other car. Safety is one of the best features of the Pilot. I never felt the impact of the accident! I spent a year researching before making my purchase. Glad I picked the Pilot! ,,,,

Honda Motor Corp,2006,21-10-2009,Q2 2006,0,4.5, I bought my Pilot just 5 months ago with 42000 miles on it. It lacked some of the exterior style elements of the competition but the interior features seem to fit our lifestyle better. The determining factor was the safety rating. This vehicle won out hands down! Lucky for me because last week I totaled my poor Pilot. This vehicle did exactly what it was supposed to do. Protect the occupants. My car's front end was totally smashed the hood was folded nearly as high as the roof and I was protected in the cab. Other than bruises from the restraints and air bag deployment I am fine and totally amazed. So now the painful part finding another one.    ,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2006,06/11/2010,Q2 2006,0.4184,4.625, I'm one of those who has a lot of use for a truck but who doesn't much like the traditional pickup arrangement. Honda Motor Corp did an intelligent job of rethinking the pickup and came up with something that for this user continues to make a whole lot of sense. I've hauled a great deal with it from wobbly old wooden boats to loads of lumber carrying 6500 pounds at 70 mph over hundreds of miles sometimes. This truck can do the work. Meanwhile I can keep my tools secure in the trunk not out in an open bed. I can carry long lumber and spars on the roof rack. It's awesome on snowy variable roads or blasting down a dirt road at 40 mph. 87k on the first set of tires. Don't get the RT--the seats stain,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2006,25-07-2010,Q2 2006,0.6239,4.75,"This an early model - only the driver's door unlocks when put in 'Park' - late '06 onwards have all four doors unlock. That's a nuisance! Another 1"" of ground clearance. Improved mileage. Auto lights; got used to this feature on GM Motor Corp machines. Now I forget to turn on the lights and get flashed a lot!",,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2006,26-08-2010,Q2 2006,0.3612,4.75, I recently bought a 2006 RT from a local Honda Motor Corp Dealer with 120000 km on it - tonneau cover too. I had been looking at them for sometime; I needed a strong reliable but comfortable truck or SUV to handle our cottage lifestyle. Towing boats trailers full of work materials or ATVs etc. but comfortable and easy to drive. Research indicated that used Ridgeline would meet all these requirements. In Billet Silver it looks pretty sharp although some in my family think it's the ugliest truck they've ever seen! But I love it! Two months into ownership and 2500 extra km on the clock it's smooth powerful reliable good on gas (averaging 10.5 L/100 km or 22/23 mpg and very comfortable.,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2006,21-10-2011,Q2 2006,0.8213,4.875, I've had a '86 Toyota Motor Corp 4x4 P/U '93 Toyota Motor Corp 4Runner and '05 Tundra. I bought the Tundra brand new over the Ridgeline because the Ridgeline had just come out in summer of '05 and I was hesitant to jump into Honda Motor Corp's first truck. What a mistake! I sold the Tundra and bought an '06 Ridgeline RTL. It is so versatile and fun to drive. Great on all kinds of terrain. Excellent utility with the bed trunk back seat (seats flip up for TONS of space). We go up to Colorado in the winter to ski I fit all of our gear in the trunk and under the rear seats skis in the bed and the 4 of us ride in comfort! I get 19mpg city and have done as good as 24mpg highway. Awesome truck!,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2006,24-02-2016,Q2 2006,0.872,5, Oir Honda Motor Corp Pilot is the best. It is so versatile and big yet drives like a small car. We have never brought the car into a repair shop for anything more than scheduled maintenance. I swear this car will run for ever. The interior has supportive seats and after 100k there is not a tear in the drivers seat leather not even wore out. Really good on the snow stability control barges in exactly when u need it. It is really just like a box so visibility is crazy good. Rearward visibility is as good as it gets with a back up camera. The only feature I would like on this pilot is just a little more horse power and torque it never feels stressed but I just LOVE power.,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2006,23-09-2005,Q3 2006,0.9384,4.75, This vehicle rides as smoothly and quietly as any car and is a pleasure to drive. It is easily manuverable corners well and is not sluggish in passing situations. Gas mileage is acceptable for this type of vehicle and the interior features are easily utilized and convenient. It is asthetically pleasing and turns heads which is uncommon for a SUV. It lives up to Honda Motor Corp's high quality standards and is user friendly both for family and individuals. It is roomy inside and able to haul a lot of cargo kids supplies etc. Seating configuration is good and easily modified and accessed. I really cannot think of anything I dislike about the Pilot. ,,,,

Honda Motor Corp,2006,30-07-2015,Q3 2006,0.4927,5," I bought new 9/06. This SUV has everything- comfort and capacity you can haul a lot! This pilot grew with my family! I've hauled 7 kids...5 kids and their stuff...multiple hockey bags and the hockey kids! We grew up through sports summer and winter. The reliability of this car has been amazing! Because it will be 10 next year I have started looking at maybe a new car. I cannot find anything out there that may hold a candle to this SUV. I didn't even mention that this baby got me through a few of the worst winters in Michigan history!!! In a foot+ of snow...I only put it in 4WD to back out my drive...then off and away through about 18"" in 2!!! If you only had the 2 wheel version- you would be fine in very deep snow. It handles unbelievably well. Once on a very narrow snow covered road after bad storm there wasn't enough room for an oncoming car to pass...I pulled into the ""bank"" on the side of the road with the hope ""we can do this""...and other car passed and I ""plowed"" through!! On my way again in 2WD! As everyone has said- the only maintenance...normal brakes tires...and very recently an alternator. The warning light went off- my husband checked- it was the alternator. He and my son changed it out for about $200! (It wasn't do-it-yourself super easy...but they managed) and we continue off every day like the ""energizer bunny""! Mileage is mediocre...but considering all this vehicle has delivered over 9 years I can forgive some frequent fill ups!

Mine has leather and the seats are very comfortable and I am a big guy (6' and 250) I have plenty of head/leg room. Nice big armrest. Lots of storage. I have AWD and this thing will NOT get stuck but I have all terrain tires. I've only had it 9 months but I love it just as much as the day I bought it.

It's a blast to drive and has so many handy little features that we didn't realize we were missing out on.  Incredibly solid on the road -- feels very substantial without feeling just plain BIG.

The Ridgeline is a wonderful tough truck and drives like a dream.  I am not a truck person per se but need an open truck bed for Home Depot runs and hauling two large dogs around town and this truck fills that need and more.  The in-bed trunk is the best as it is located at the tail gate the Sport Trac's large in- bed trunk is located behind the rear window so you would have to get up into the bed just to put something in the trunk.  For the first 1500 miles I have been averaging 18 mpg in the City.  Not bad for truck this size.  The V6 engine offers plenty of power.,,,,

Honda Motor Corp,2007,25-12-2006,Q4 2007,0,4.875, Unless you intend to off-road the Ridgeline is pretty much perfect.  The ride is smooth quiet and refined.  The engine won't kill you with acceleration but it's better than adequate.  Inside materials and design are amazing. Safety features abound.  Perfect for long road trips daily commuting and everything in between.  Gas mileage is better than expected-- 18 in mixed city/freeway up to 22 or 23 on road trips.  Only complaint is that the exterior is very susceptible to dings-- the paint/body hardware could probably use some reinforcement.   People who review this automobile poorly probably have never been in one.  ,,,,

Much easier to enter/exit more useable space much more power (even with auto). Having a small child the rear seat height and tall roof make it relatively easy to put him in and out of the car seat. Took looong roadtrip with my wife and child and enjoyed the comfort of ""relax mode"" even with the trunk full of stuff. Great highway mileage (37-40) but city mileage has been lackluster for such a small car (23-26). So far that has been my biggest gripe. ",,,,

Agree that the two back headrests cause blind spot and would have liked a moon or sun roof option but all in all it's your best bang for the buck!!

CRV felt a little tight for 4 tops.  Preferred the superior quality of the leather in the Pilot.  CRV leather felt thin and has a tufted look which some may prefer but we don't.

With gas prices on the rise and every year fewer and fewer trips to Home Depot for home and yard repair I started looking at something more economic.  I did all of my homework because I needed a crew cab for my family.  I went with the Honda Motor Corp because it offered more for my money.  It was about 5000 cheaper than the Toyota Motor Corp it has a high resale value better gas economy cheaper insurance and was more comfortable.

Recently the battery wouldn't start and after reading other forums regarding this issue I see that there are many many people with even more mileage and less that have had either the same problem (battery not charging) or battery dieing within less than 2 years!

I will let it be known I've been the sole owner of this car and have all maintenance done at Honda Motor Corp (oil changes/inspections). Since passing the 150k mark I've had the car towed twice once for a bad fuel pump ($700) the second time because the accelerator coils and water pump went out completely. The second issue ended up costing around $1500 because valve adjustments and new parts. The check engine light has come on several times since and needless to say I'm now afraid of driving this thing down the street. So beware after 150k it's a money pit!,,,,

Honda Motor Corp,2008,30-01-2013,Q2 2008,0.2942,4.25, I bought my Fit new in 2008. At the time I loved it. Since then its various issues have worn down my support for the vehicle. Now I'm considering selling it even though it's still pretty new. The ride quality and road noise are getting to me and the car lacks certain basic amenities like cruise control (my fault for getting the base model) adjustable intermittent length for the front wipers (that's right it's every 4 seconds or nothing) and any intermittent setting for the rear wiper (it's either on or off).,,,,

Honda Motor Corp,2008,01/03/2010,Q3 2008,0,4.75, I'm sad to see my Ridgeline lease come to an end.  Never been in a truck that rode as smooth or quiet.  It handled beautifully too.  Interior was spacious in the front and the back plenty of room for 4 adults and 5 if necessary. The rear seat swinging up came in handy.  The inbed trunk is huge and was great for storing various items including a golf bag.  The only negative I can give this is that I live in Philadelphia and it got a little less than 15 mpg.  It's the only reason I'm giving it up.  When they come out with a hybrid I'll be back :) ,,,,

Honda Motor Corp,2008,16-03-2008,Q4 2008,-0.508,5, When my 1999 Civic was stolen and would have cost too much money to repair I was heartbroken. I didn't have much money at the time and couldn't afFord Motor Corp to buy a new Civic (and the new ones didn't appeal to me) so I started looking at more afFord Motor Corpable cars but really didn't want anything but a Honda Motor Corp. The Fit was a perfect match for me. What made me attracted to it was the hatchback and extra trunk space because I barely ever have passengers. When I had the Civic it was always a pain to fit things in the trunk and fold the seats down with only 2 doors. It felt cramped especially with passengers in the back seat. ,,,,

Friend had leg surgery: We were able to put down the front seat (flat) & she sat in back with her leg completely extended. Transported a 9x12 rug with no problem. Got 42 mpg on a road trip out west. Minor complaints: the Sport trim hangs too low and gets scratched up easily. My fog lights have both broken twice (not protected enough?). No map lights. Road noise. Overall though a nearly perfect car in terms of economy excellent use of space being fun to drive and (dare I say it?) basic cuteness. This is an AWESOME car for the price!!,,,,

Keep the fluids fresh as it affects gas mileage greatly (3-4 mpg). If this were quieter it's a 5 out of 5 but don't expect it to replace a full size truck that's not a beef just a reality.

Honda Motor Corp,2009,18-11-2009,Q4 2009,0.4033,4.875, I am a high-spirited driver and drive 110 miles one-way to work so needed a fuel efficient car that had zip. 10000+ miles already since June 2008. Depending on my driving habits I average 40+ highway/35 mixed (highest was 52 MPG for one trip at 60 MPH!). This car has great acceleration when you punch it for entering traffic and passing but don't expect a rocket car. Maneuverability is excellent although real tight cornering causes the back end to sway. The seats are not very comfortable for long distances but I generally like the interior styling. Visibility is excellent with nice large side mirrors. Nice rear seat flexibility for transporting my big dog and cargo. Great car overall!,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2009,23-11-2009,Q4 2009,0.4927,4.75, I bought a Ridgeline 3 weeks ago.  Have used it for hauling dirt bikes firewood and took it deer hunting in the woods.  This thing does it all for the everyday man.  Not for the contractor worker.  Runs great peppy hugs the road - no lean. First out I did trip displays got 18.2 - 20.3 mpg.  Not bad for 500 miles on it.  Compares to mpg on my Chevy silverado.  Roomy front and back seats and lots of storage.  Love the trunk idea.  Works great for locking the chain saw in and other valuables.  A good all-around multi-use vehicle for the everyday dad/man.  ,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2009,23-12-2009,Q4 2009,0.8941,4, Bought this truck to carry two Honda Motor Corp dirt bikes in the back and to tow a tent trailer all at the same time. I love this truck and it does everything I need a truck to do and more. Plus it is a Honda Motor Corp with outstanding quality fantastic ride and great gas mileage for a bigger truck.

Honda Motor Corp,2011,12/01/2010,Q1 2011,0.2263,4.625, As a previous owner of a CRX-DX (7-years) this CRZ is a welcome pleasure. I traded in my 2001 A4 1.8TQ for this little piece of heaven. It is nice getting back to a smooth clutch. The Audi was a little long on both travel and throw. The exterior styling is a mix of Porsche 928 rear end & heavily modified S2000 front. The interior high end with soft touch controls like the Audi. The well placed control close to the driver. The 6 weeks has been unbelievable in the gas mileage. I am just about to fill up for the third time with: 41.7 43.5 and 43.4 for miles/gal. avg. Not bad for a 80 City / 20 Highway driving.

But I am just going to switch them out eventually. Easy fix.  2) My biggest gripe about this car. ITS SO LOW! I love low cars. I have a classic Camaro that sits just about as low as any other car. But it's the nose that's the problem here. I can't even park my car in the garage or drive way because it scrapes so bad.

Having had the car for about two years now we still love it. Part of me wishes they would come out with a 4 seater version but then I guess it would loose some of its appeal? There is a WHOLE lot of room in this tiny car. I kid you not we bought a queen sized bed frame mattress etc (From Ikea of course -.-) and we fit it in the car?! Amazing.

I've driven faster cars and while this isn't going to win many races it has more than ample power and torque to make it quick and nimble and very enjoyable to drive. So far on my commute around Seattle which includes heavy traffic and some fairly open highways I get roughly 43 mpg using econ mode. I haven't tested with normal or sport.

I began calculating gas costs of my 1997 gas eater and decided it was time to look around. I looked at all kinds of different models hybrids new used etc. I finally settled on the CR-Z as my first choice for test drive and once I drove it that was it.

Honda Motor Corp,2013,29-07-2013,Q2 2013,0,4.875,     The new 2017 Honda Motor Corp Ridgeline has come out now and Honda Motor Corp was able to give us something new and take away something at the same time.  They gave us a truck that resembles most other trucks on the market they kept what works from the original Ridgeline and added some new things to pay for.  It's not cool to have to pay for features once standard equipment ie AWD and electric rear window.  The new Ridgeline is nice but now since I have taken 3 years to get to like my Ridgeline I like the old style just a little better.  Honda Motor Corp fell short on knocking my socks off with its new design new colors and new features.  The one thing Honda Motor Corp never falls short on is quality and the fact that Honda Motor Corps just work and work well. I will eventually own a new Ridgeline why not they are a great vehicle but my 2013 Ridgeline is still a great truck.  It runs well looks good drives the best quiet and reliable. It's a Honda Motor Corp.,,,,

Honda Motor Corp,2013,10/01/2013,Q4 2013,0,4.875,I drove all of the smaller pickups in the market and found the Honda Motor Corp Ridgeline to be the right size 4 wheel capability smooth riding relatively quiet and fully capable for what I need in a pickup. Getting the Honda Motor Corp reliability was a plus. We drove it around town for the first 4K miles and it was a pleasure driving it in an urban setting easy to park great for those occasional trips to buy furniture and good looking enough for date nights. You guessed it I don't miss my F-150.  50000 + miles later and my Ridgeline is still driving like new. Have only done the scheduled maintenance including regular oil changes and new transmission oil.

Honda Motor Corp,2014,22-04-2014,Q1 2014,0.6901,4.875, I've had my base Hybrid for a month and put a little over 2K miles on it. It's been amazing so far. I've averaged about 48 mpg so far in mixed driving which probably be higher if temps didn't drop below freezing which caused me to average about 36 mpg on my current tank. Handling is good for a big sedan and it feels like it has as much power as my former '04 Accord EX-L V6 Navi. Brakes are smooth and linear unlike the jerky brakes found on the Prius's I've rented. Seats are supportive and comfortable and the interior fit and finish is quite good. I find the infotainment system to be decently intuitive. The base audio system is ok though not great. ,,,,

Honda Motor Corp,2014,07/10/2015,Q1 2014,0.6858,3, Once my civic hit 99k I decided it was time to upgrade comfort power and size.  When I saw the mileage ratings of 45/50 and read the reviews I was hooked.  I purchased the car about 6 months ago and have driven 21K miles.  AVG mpg since the start is 38.5.  OK I realize I drive a little faster than most (75 avg on hwy) and I also realize that I purchased the car in the dead of winter (which I am told will adversely affect mileage) but 10mpg under??.  The ride is great the comfort is great and overall I am happy with the vehicle.  Is the car worth the extra money to upgrade to the hybrid? not unless you keep it for 500000 plus miles.  Also I am having a couple of issues. 1 - There are about 25 paint chip marks on the very front of the hood I never had this with any vehicle I have purchased (this is my 12th new purchase).  2 - There is a knocking sound on the passenger side when starting out or stopping that has been there from day 1 it almost sounds like a spring popping.  I mentioned it when I was in for an oil change at the dealer but was told a mechanic was not available.  So I just made an appointment a week from now so we will see.,,,,

I do not want a traditional man's truck. I look at your 2017 Honda Motor Corp ridgeline and just feel so bad. It is not even a semblance of it's original great self. Won't you reconsider?

Answer: the CR-Z. It took us two years to be able to buy one since we do need one car with more space but as a second vehicle for commuting and weekend errands it's perfect. We had to work out a weekly trade-off to avoid fighting over who got to drive it. It took a little getting used to because it is small but it hugs the road beautifully. The side mirrors are built smart for better visibility and even the base model includes a Google Glass back-up camera (I miss it when driving our other car!). Bottom line: we LOVE it!,,,,

I added leather to my base Hybrid and still saved almost $4000 over buying the EX-L as the my dealer was willing to negotiate for the base and not the EX-L. ,,,,

I regularly get around 53 mpg city but my highway mpg runs around 37 even with the econ button on (I have a bit of a lead foot). The mpg is effected more in cold weather than traditional cars.

Honda Motor Corp,2015,16-03-2015,Q1 2015,0.3089,4.75,"However I was unaware of just how disappointingly choppy the car's ride would be when the it's software switches between electric engine and gas engine... especially when driving faster than 40 MPH at constant speed. I failed to realize this during the original test drive because I only drove it on the freeway for about one mile (and in heavy afternoon traffic). In short (whether using cruise control or not) the 2015 Accord Hybrid will intermittently pause and then surge whenever the electric engine disengages from action at speeds north of 35-40 MPH. This is both annoying and disconcerting since it results in a choppy ride. I took my new Accord Hybrid to the dealer service folks twice for this problem. The first time I was told to stop using the ECON mode if I wanted a smoother ride. The second time I insisted on speaking with the service tech.  Here's the exact verbiage from the service ticket: ""NFP test drove the vehicle and verified customers concern. Took snap shots during the event of the PGM Motor Corp-FI system... etc.. After review of all the snap shot data was sent it was determined that it is the normal operation of this vehicle."" That's a pretty poor response from Honda Motor Corp.

Honda Motor Corp,2016,23-08-2016,Q2 2016,-0.7159,5, My wife & I wanted a two-seater with some cargo space that's fun to drive and doesn't cost too much. This Honda Motor Corp CRZ hybrid is exactly what we were looking for. We test drove several roadsters and none came close in terms of purchase price and fuel economy. With its 3 driving modes we have it all from 36 mpg average (1/3 city & 2/3 hwy) to thrilling performance. In the sport mode this is a little rocket ship and handles as well as other roadsters we tested. For around $21000 (new) it's a great value--nice & comfortable interior attractive gauges and decor good entertainment system w/ bluetooth plenty of cargo room great handling. Road and engine noise are a bit loud but that's a part of being a roadster. Other cars we own are Ford Motor Corp Explorer Mercedes R350 & a Prius so this fits in very nicely with our collection. We would have liked this to be a convertible. But all things considered that's a small sacrifice. This rocket ship is just plain fun to drive without bleeding my pocket book. MPG would be better if we drove more in ECO mode but that defeats the point of having a roadster!,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,29-01-2017,Q1 2017,0.984,5, We looked at the Tahoe Armada and Highlander and the pilot won us over on its winning combination of performance economy advanced AWD system and value. We travel to Vermont often on narrow private roads that are not always plowed well. Honda Motor Corp's i-VTM is really the Acura SH-AWD with torque vectoring. On dry roads it helps some but it is also a winner in the deep snow shifting power left to right as well as front to back as needed. Really great system. The cargo space in this rig is HUGE especially with part or all of the 3rd row down. The cargo area is equivalent is size to the Tahoe and more usable as the load floor is lower.  The acceleration is decent and I like the intake noise as the VTEC kicks in at higher revs. Without flogging it I've seen high 20s for MPG on the highway. Overall over the first 1500 miles we've gotten 23 MPG combined.  The 9 speed feels a bit weird around 4th or 5th gear but it isn't a big deal. The push button shifter took some getting use to but after a day we were used to it and it wasn't a big deal. I really liked the looks of the Tahoe but for the money (and even not considering the money) the Pilot is an unbeatable combo of utility economy and performance.,,,,

Honda Motor Corp,2017,03/02/2017,Q1 2017,0.7351,4,I really wanted to purchase the EX-L trim with V6. But ending up purchasing the Touring trim.  With respect to the EX-L trim.  Why is Honda Motor Corp forcing the consumer to select between one of:  Honda Motor Corp Sense navigation or rear entertainment?  These three options can not be combined on the EX-L.  A Honda Motor Corp salesman tried to convince me that built-in navigation is no longer necessary with addition of Andriod Auto and Apple CarPlay.  If you have ever traveled to rural areas without cellphone data coverage you'll understand the need for built-in navigation.,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,03/12/2017,Q1 2017,0.9021,5, I bought the Touring model because the Elite model did not have the right side camera only blind spot indicator in both mirrors.  I would say the blind spot indicator in the left hand side would be handy but prefer the camera on the right.  There are so many things I love about this Pilot that I can't pick out one favorite.  Engine Idle stop at a light is awesome.  Push button shift is fabulous.  Navigation takes some time to figure out the ins and outs but it is great.  Love the Adapative Cruise Control and Lane departure warning.,,,,

Honda Motor Corp,2017,22-03-2017,Q1 2017,0.6908,3,"The 'Honda Motor Corp Lane Watch'.  If this is such a great feature why doesn't the Elite have two cameras (both driver and passenger sides)?  Instead the Elite adds real 'Blind Spot' detection feature.  I would much rather have the blind spot detection with large illuminated icon on the side mirrors instead of the 'Honda Motor Corp Lane Watch'.  If the majority of your turns are in the right lane you will quickly understand the annoyance (don't need to see grass or sidewalk).  An illuminated icon on the side mirror is quick for the driver to process.  Whereas the ""Honda Motor Corp Lane Watch"" requires the driver to remove their eyes from the road and look at the in dash monitor to determine if there is a car in the lane.  The main point of safety features is to help the driver focus on the road.  Which ""Honda Motor Corp Lane Watch"" doesn't because you have to watch live video feed and make decision.",,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,31-03-2017,Q1 2017,-0.905,5, I've owned/driven Honda Motor Corps for the last 25 years and have always been satisfied with fit finish reliability and safety and I have come to take these things for granted from Honda Motor Corp.  The point is up to now I was just satisfied but the 2017 Pilot has blown me away with seemingly all the things I didn't even know I needed.  I've never owned a vehicle with remote start but now I use it almost daily.  I love the auto door unlock/lock feature.  In the past when leaving my vehicle my hands were full and I used to have to fumble for the door lock FOB and juggle packages.  Now I just walk away and the vehicle takes care of itself.  When I return I don't need to unlock the doors I just grab the door handle and the doors unlock.  Don't buy navigation just use Android Auto it integrates well with all of the other Audio options.  I know these are just minor things but the cumulative effect of all the minor design improvements are going to WOW you and make you appreciate your decision to buy this car.  It's fun to drive looks good and gets good mileage.  I don't think you will regret it.,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,05/04/2017,Q1 2017,0.9718,5, I have been a loyal Acura owner for years.  But after drving the MDX  I liked the features and looks on the Pilot better.  Could not Justify the 9700 difference in price.  If the the price was the same id still by the Pilot.  Only 1000 miles so far but i love the Pilot.,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,06/03/2017,Q1 2017,0.3612,2, This is our 4th New SUV in 13 years.  This is the first one I have ever had to take to the dealer with a problem before 70000 mile.  This car developed a clunk in the front drive train or suspension at about 3000 miles.  Of course the service department can find nothing wrong with it.  Honda Motor Corp is behind it's competitors when it comes to interior design.  Less leg room in the front driving compartment controls are dated other companies have lessen to their focus groups.  I think Honda Motor Corp miss the boat here.  Blind spot camara is useless who looks at their center screen when changing lanes.  Really missed the boat here when comparing them to there competitors.  To many bad interior design features to mention.,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,06/07/2017,Q1 2017,0.8978,5, The Honda Motor Corp Pilot is a very well built high quality automobile.  It drives good rides good and is very quiet on the road.  It is filled with technology----almost to a fault.  It will take my wife and me some time to learn all of its features.  It is very smooth and is getting very good gas mileage.  I can't imagine that any SUV being made could have more features than does the Pilot.  It is also very roomy.  It also has all wheel drive and stability control so is very sure footed in rain or snow.,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,06/09/2017,Q1 2017,0.7906,5, Good value for the money,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,19-01-2017,Q2 2017,0.9114,5, I really like the design of the 2017 Honda Motor Corp pilot.   It's attractive on the outside  comfortable on the inside.   A few concerns though.  The rear seats could be a little more comfortable but at least they are not used every day.   It also seems like the heat takes a while to really kick in which was not what I was expecting for a brand-new vehicle but perhaps because it's a large space it takes a while.   Also the Bluetooth has not consistently worked.   Overall a five star car though great in snow and ice and very good gas mileage for this type of vehicle.,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,20-01-2017,Q2 2017,0.6696,5, Sporty spacious good fuel economy is a great family car,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,15-03-2017,Q2 2017,0.882,4, With my growing family and constant trips to a mountain cabin we needed more space that we had in our old Forester but couldn't give up solid AWD and high clearance to make it.  The Pilot does this well--good power clearance and traction with a ton of room.  It's a larger vehicle though so if you put things on your roof you'll need to be tall or carry a step stool since there are not good external steps.  I'm not a fan of the roof rails for attachments as it means I can't reuse my older Thule setup.  Finally I'm not crazy with the entertainment system--it can be easy to get lost in different contexts.  For example switching from listening to the radio to   Spotify is a multistep process that can take some getting used to.,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,04/12/2017,Q2 2017,0.9673,1, It doesn't feel like an SUV.  It's like a car combined with a mini van. Loose steering slow draggie start up sits lower so not able to treat like SUV. Lower interior limits hauling anything large.  Seller was very limited on the knowledge of the vehicle and until I received the owner's manual I didn't realize the limitations on the stereo/interface system that doesn't meet my needs.  Irresponsible information from the seller caused ordering of wrong equipment.  Overall disappointed with this vehicle and wish I had looked elsewhere. Nothing great about this car for the money spent.,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,05/10/2017,Q2 2017,-0.8036,5, We test drove the 2017 EX-L 4WD but ended up buying the 2WD instead.  There was no noticeable difference.  And given the area we live in we'd rather save the money.,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,27-05-2017,Q2 2017,-0.9411,4, Good comfort and expected performance since I was a 2005 Pilot owner. New features such as back up camera and passenger side camera for lane change and blind spot are great. Too bad it didn't include driver's side as well. Side mirrors fold back on this model is something that I wish was electronically adjustable as I fold them back every day manually. Plenty of room and great console. Plenty of compartments on the doors and back area's. Love the hatchback open ability from the key ring. Easy to open and close without having to do it manually. Touch unlock on the doors and key less start a big plus. Getting used to the higher ride for distance estimating in front takes a little getting used to. You can't really see the front of the car to judge how close you are. Bluetooth match up fine for our two Android phones however the interface for playing music from our phones doesn't have the flexibility for selecting songs albums or playlists that the phone does. Using google maps from the phone interface works fine.,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,06/09/2017,Q2 2017,0.4159,4, Needs USB ports in back seat area. Needs volume control. LKAS needs to be better. ACC is a really great feature but should be smoother. I think I would like to be seen more in a Jeep Rubicon or even a  Jeep Grand Cherokee but the Pilot beat it the highlander and the Explorer in all the measurable categories.,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,13-06-2017,Q2 2017,0.6041,2, I know I should love this car and I know old ladies shouldn't swear.  But I freaking hate this car and wish I had bought an older model which is sad because I haven't bought a new car in 13 years!  1)Auto Stop - if you are stopped for a tiny amount of time the engine will shut off and restart when you move the steering wheel or take your foot off the brake.  IT IS UNNERVING!!  When I bought the car the dealer said you can turn that irritation off but he meant you have to turn it off every time you start the car.  2)The freaking BEEPING - you can turn the incessant beeping off and risk backing into a brick wall if you're not used to the camera or you can leave it on and have it annoy the living @!,%& out of you - when you're backing out of an underground spot with nothing for 2-3' in any direction when you're rounding a tight turn on your daily trip home (??????) or when it thinks you're too close to a car in front of you - I'm not yet dead I'm not blind if I'm that close to a car in front of me it's because I WANT TO BE!!  3)The incredibly stupid feature that unlocks all the windows - my boyfriend says it's unlocking the doors then holding the unlock button down.  However it happened to me when I LOCKED the car and not sure what got pressed as the key jostled in my purse.  In any case who EVER wants all their windows opened unless they're IN THE CAR?  I live in Seattle - rain rain and more rain twice now in my car completely accidentally.  In summary of the features TOO $%^&& MUCH! When I want a driverless car I'll get one til then LET ME DRIVE THE CAR!!!!!  And finally I don't know if it's suspension or what but going over  speed bumps or into a big profile driveway  (dozens of times a day for most people) is  detrimental to your spine.,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,18-07-2016,Q3 2017,0.9414,5, I have to say being in the car business and working for another brand that pick up isn't available took me a long time to decide which one would be the best hands down mid size pick up truck out there if you are in the market for a midsize pick up truck take 20 minutes of your time  and go to the nearest Honda Motor Corp dealer and test drive the new 2017 Ridgeline and you will understand what I'm talking about you basically getting a Acura Pick up truck a step a head of Tacoma Frontier Colorado etc! You will not be disappointed!!! Good luck!,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,19-07-2016,Q3 2017,0.9823,5, Had this truck for three weeks and already taken it on a long haul trip. 26mpg was surprisingly good.  We love the vehicle and at the moment I can't come up with a criticism.  Our first truck and first Honda Motor Corp!,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,22-07-2016,Q3 2017,0.9901,5, **Update after 1 year - still enjoying the vehicle and after a year of combined highway and city driving looks like 43 MPG is about average. In the city at 20-50 MPH stop and go you can easily get 49 or 50 MPG but on the highway over 70 brings you back to reality. With all factors combines this is still the best car I have ever owned.,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,08/09/2016,Q3 2017,0.8271,5, I liked the looks of the Tacoma and Colorado quite a bit more than the Ridgeline but after test driving all three there was no doubt in my mind which one I would buy. If not the comfort then the tech if not the tech then the active safety equipment. I absolutely love the fold up rear seats and the trunk bed well worth the slightly higher bed height,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,15-08-2016,Q3 2017,0.938,5,I love this truck.,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,18-08-2016,Q3 2017,0.8705,5,"I was new to hybrids in 2013 and purchased a 2013 Hyundai Sonata and loved that vehicle right off the bat and was sold on hybrids. With that car I averaged 38 mpg on the highway and was thrilled that I could go over 500 miles before having to fill up. The argument at the time was the hybrid cost more and based on mpg it would take you X years to break even. While this might be a logical value/$ spent thought I for one loved the fact that I was doing my part to help with the ecology and consuming less gas which made me feel good and I was sold. While I loved this first hybrid I was keeping an eye out for Honda Motor Corp's latest model waiting the entire 2016 model year for the 2017's which have just begun arriving at dealerships as I am a long time Honda Motor Corp fan ( have owned 4 or 5 Honda Motor Corp vehicles). From a ""regular guy"" point of view there is almost nothing about this car I do like like from the fantastic mpg to the great audio system to elegant interior. So far I am averaging 46 mpg combined and an thrilled to see my driving range to empty is about 700 miles. The mpg highway is an interesting number as it never states at what speed was the mpg highway determined. On a recent trip I set the cruise to 70 mph on mostly straight roads and after 2 hours of driving the mpg was listed as 42 mpg. I suspect if I drove 65 mph or 60 mph the mpg might have gotten closer to the published rate but who would drive that speed :-). The only issue I noticed is with Apple Car Play which acts strange at times with accepting phone calls and instances in which there seems to be a software tug of war between Honda Motor Corp car software and Apple as to which product should control a feature.When I do have an issue rebooting the phone does nothing and it requires me to turn off the car then retry which corrects the problem. The car is very very well built and feels more like a Lexus than a hybrid sedan. As I have only had the car for 4 days barring something totally out of the blue and unexpected I would highly recommend purchasing this vehicle and forget the extra cost/how many years to recoup argument and enjoy the ride! (Update 7/26/16) - Resolved the carplay issue as being caused by using both Carplay and Bluetooth at the same time - use one or the other but not both together. On another note I achieved 50.8 mpg in the city by driving with caution and playing with the gas pedal as Hybrid owners will understand what I am referring to. I am not up to 44 mpg combined over 6 days.",,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,09/04/2016,Q3 2017,0.8555,5, Traded in my 2016 Tacoma TRD-Offroad Double-Cab Long-Bed truck to get the new Ridgeline.  I was forced to down-size after moving across the country to a house with a crowded garage.  My F150 just barely fit in our garage and leaving it outside isn't an option due to the brutal sun and hail storms of Colorado.  I had to choose between the Tacoma and the Colorado truck when I down-sized at the time.  Definitely wasn't thrilled with either option but the Tacoma edged-out the Colorado.  My Tacoma (and the Colorado) have lack-luster acceleration.  Driving the Tacoma to work and back on not-so-wonderful roads was punishing at times.  Sure the Tacoma is a great off-road vehicle but it needs much better manners to be a daily driver.  I could go on about the Tacoma but I'll stop here.  The 2017 Ridgeline I was a little skeptical about but I was really wanting to find a better mid-sized truck option.  When the Ridgeline was available in my area for a test drive I had to try it out.  My wife had a 2013 Honda Motor Corp Pilot that we really liked and I knew this new truck had the latest version of the engine from the Pilot.  Wow! What a difference!   Smooth quiet powerful and much roomier inside the cabin.  My son couldn't sit in the back of my Tacoma as his head would be touching the roof of the cab.  The Ridgeline has plenty of head room for my son and in spite of the really cool stadium rear seating in the Ridgeline he still has inches of head room to spare.  The Ridgeline has already delivered as high as 30MPG for me on the highway and I can average 25-26MPG in mixed driving (I do use the ECON mode about half the time).  The lowest I've seen it get while driving in the mountains was a tad over 22MPG.  This is using the lower octane gas (85).  The ride is smooth just a little stiffer than our Pilot due to have a suspension more suitable for a truck.  The handling is awesome.  The AWD and suspension made it a fun vehicle to drive on the twisty mountain roads.  In fact the AWD is full-time torque-vectoring very much like what you would get in a Subaru.  Before looking into the Ridgeline I assumed it would be FWD by default and then the rear wheels kick-in when needed but not so...  We will be pulling a camping trailer later with the Ridgeline (probably one that weighs around 3200lbs as the max towing capacity is 5000lbs also a trailer brake controller will be installed on the Ridgeline) and I will report on how that goes.   The only thing about the Ridgeline that I find a little annoying is that the brake peddle is a little mushier than what I'm used to.  BTW...this truck is fast and highly responsive!,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,09/11/2016,Q3 2017,0.9813,5, The hwy mileage has been as high as 31 mpg.  Mostly at 27 to 29 mpg hwy. Combined mileage 23 to 27.  Way better than my 2006 and 2012 Ridgeline.  I just wish all the RTL models had the sliding rear window.  This model was a great value at $37000. March 2017. Update.  Just took a 5600 mile road trip south and west to Arizona.   Average mileage was 26 mpg. Many speed limits were 80 mph.  Great truck.  Mileage on vehicle now 14000.,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,09/12/2016,Q3 2017,0.3612,5, I bought my Ridgeline about 2 months ago when they first came out and I am In Love!!! This is my first truck and 2nd Honda Motor Corp (06 Honda Motor Corp Accord) and I have found the perfect truck for me. I live in the city and just need a truck on weekends and moving stuff once in a while. This is perfect the Ridgeline is so quiet and drives like a SUV. I sometimes forget that I am driving a truck. Gas is not an issue I have to fill it up once a week if that. the technology is great. Apple Carplay Bluetooth Navigation rear view and side view cameras its all there! the Inside is comfortable quiet and has tons of storage space. When I am stopped at a stop light people stare so being one of the first to drive around in one of these is pretty cool too. Highly recommend this truck for people like me that dont need a big Truck for their everyday lives but for the people that drive to the office back and forth Monday through Friday but need that extra truck space every once in a while.,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,24-09-2016,Q3 2017,0.8951,5, The truck has great visibility features handling and comfort.  It combines the feel of driving an SUV or crossover with a bed.  If I wanted a semi I'd buy one.  So the people that feel that it's 'not a real truck' - whatever enjoy your 3 mpg and stepladder mounted to the side.  You haul the same amount as I do in all likelihood...  but yes I might want something larger if I was towing a yacht  or megacamper or concrete or something.  Then consider a megatruck.,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,19-10-2016,Q3 2017,-0.3324,5, I went through Tacoma Canyon Ridgeline and Colorado. Exactly in that order. Money wise Colorado is your best but it's also the worst in terms of design handling and overall quality. Canyon is just little better but still far inferior to Tacoma. Both Colorado and Canyon are example how not to design interior of small tuck imo it's just horrible. Tacoma low sitting position is beyond awkward and the best off road capability is not sell option for me in Florida where I live. I was surprise how good Ridgeline stands among others - roomy interior very good quality fit and finish SUV like ride and this bed trunk where I'm diving so very often for my tools. I have bed where I can lay flat 4x8 and dual action tailgate to dive into the trunk. For me bed trunk is huge advantage 'cos any tool box installed on bed render it somehow useless. Ridgeline is not perfect ( which truck is ? ) I found quite annoying that rear cab doors can't be fully open to 90 deg.,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,20-10-2016,Q3 2017,0.4017,5,"Update: I've put 12000 plus miles on my Ridgeline in the first 6 months. From Colorado to Atlantic Beach where this truck really shines is on long cross country drives.  Crossing the Kansas prairie with the adaptive cruise control set on 77 I averaged 27.8 MPG. The Lane Keeper Assist technology takes some getting ""used to"" the first time you feel the truck gently turning the steering wheel in your hands it is a bit unsettling. However this combination of semi autonomous features is most helpful on long interstate  drives. It's comforting to know the truck will not run over that car slowing in front of you and it will help you stay in your lane. This week while getting some service work done I sat in a new sport edition Ridgeline just for comparison. It confirmed my decision to buy the top of the line Black Edition.  One wierd service issue came up for about the last 6 thousand miles I have been hearing  a noise that seemed to be coming from the front suspension the first dealer that performed an oil change could not find anything wrong. After listening to this rattle and getting increasingly annoyed I took it to a second dealer and asked to demonstrate the noise for the technician. He said immediately it sounds like someone left a tool in there. 2 hours later he produced a small penlight flashlight that was found in the radiator support bracket. Since I had never seen the flashlight before and the noise started before it's first service I'm not sure how it got in there. But the noise is gone. ",,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,11/05/2016,Q3 2017,0.7705,5, I rarely write reviews of anything I buy so for me to write this review really says something. I have had my Accord Hybrid EXL for 6 weeks and so far I love it. I commute 50 miles round trip per day in stop and go traffic. I absolutely hated driving but now I (almost) look forward to it! The leather interior looks great and is very comfortable. The bluetooth feature and is my favorite. The car's exterior design is very cool and sleek. The ride is extremely quiet and the gas mileage is great. I am actually surprised from other reviews that others are averaging less than advertised. From my calculations I am getting 48-49 mpg but I do drive less aggressively than I used to and keep it on the ECO setting all of the time so that could make a difference for some people. Before I bought this car I did  a great deal of research. Based on my needs it is the perfect car for me. I can't say enough good things about it. If you are in the market for a hybrid I highly recommend this car.,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,22-11-2016,Q3 2017,0.9865,5, I'm 2 months into ownership and absolutely love the Ridgeline RTL-E. It's smooth comfortable and elegant with the alloys running boards chrome and rear tri-fold cover. It's a head turner in pearl white.  This is my first truck and it's everything I will ever need in utility. If you're looking to drive in comfort and have the ability to pick up stuff at Home Depot and could care less about hauling and off road this is more truck then you'll ever need. This truck is well mannered car- like and composed and I love all of the tech features lane departure collision mitigation and the auto hi-beams. Audio has great sound Navigation is great but the touch screen is quirky and takes some getting used to. I think they should change the touch screen going forward. They need to add cooled seats and outside mirror signals as the RTL-E is the top of the line. Lastly the tailgate does not lock; bummer. Overall great truck!,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,01/09/2017,Q3 2017,0.4404,5,The Touring and Elite has 'Engine Stop' feature.  The Honda Motor Corp Pilot isn't a hybrid like Toyota Motor Corp Prius so not sure why Honda Motor Corp engineers felt this feature was necessary.  Really annoying in stop-and-go city traffic.  When you come to a complete stop the engine shuts down.  There is capability to disable 'Engine Stop' but must be disabled each time you start the car.,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,07/08/2016,Q4 2017,0.8596,5, I had narrowed my purchase options  down to 4 door 4 wd compact trucks; Tacoma Colorado and Ridgeline. the first Ridgeline I was able to drive was the Black Edition. I was always leaning toward a Tacoma but I test drove the Tacoma Colorado and Ridgeline back to back. Unfortunately the Tacoma engine- transmission gearing feels wrong on the  highway with the cruise control on the Tacoma had to downshift and was screaming to maintain 70 mph up a small hill. The Ridgeline in contrast feels smooth refined powerful the engine is not screaming to maintain 70 mph up a small hill on the highway.  The Colorado actually finished in second place in my new truck list it feels smaller inside.   I choose the Ridgeline; Honda Motor Corp reliability gas mileage handling & ride. I wasn't sure I was going to like the way it looked from the official photos but when I saw the BE I loved the modern new truck look. This Ridgeline combines the functionality of and takes the place of my Subaru Forester and my old 93 2wd Toyota Motor Corp truck. In my first 500 miles I turned the Econ mode on and got 27 mpg with the adaptive cruise control set at 70 mph. When I switched Econ off and drive normal combined city highway at speeds exceeding 75 mph I still got 24 mpg. I can live with that mpg.  The interior feels large and refined mine has lots of leather and more technological bells  and whistles than I need Adaptive cruise control keyless entry push button start Apple car-play rear camera blind spot warning cross traffic monitor lane  departure warning-correction emergency front collision avoidance braking sunroof power rear slider power everything 540 watt stereo three zone climate control with rear vents Led lights everyplace multiple usb  ports and the best party trick is the truck bed audio system. The Ridgeline Black edition feels like; a luxury car a sports car a big suv and a truck all rolled into one.  I don't plan to go off roading I plan to take long trips tailgate  fill the back seat with grandkids and occasionally haul a full sheet of plywood or a load of mulch. It's early but I love it!,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,07/11/2016,Q4 2017,0.7712,4,Jan 2017 Update:  As a suburban DIY and weekend warrior I am still loving this truck.  Cons I've found are: 1. No power retractable mirrors.  It would be easier to pull into the garage with this simple feature available on the Pilot.  2. The fog lights are not LED (not optional) and don't look very impressive when paired with the awesome LED headlights.,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,13-08-2016,Q4 2017,0.9816,5, It's near perfect. I'm new to Hybrids/EV and almost got the Chevy Volt...but this 2017 is SO spacious and gorgeous. I have the fully loaded touring and the LED lights make a beautiful statement. The car accelerates wonderfully and it is a very stable drive with great turning radius for its size. I'm not 100% in love with the touch screen/navigation because it can be slow at times but it's not bad. The interior is luxurious and I love that the backseat is just as nice as the front in terms of comfort and space. The exterior chrome accents and wheels are very nice and the general shape of the hybrid is sporty but elegant and I highly recommend you get black! :) mileage is great especially for those work commutes involving traffic (quality EV time). GET THIS CAR you won't regret it.,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,15-08-2016,Q4 2017,0.9451,5, Have put about 500 miles on my new Ridgeline which is replacing a 2006 Ridgeline with 210000 miles on it.  Very pleased so far.,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,17-08-2016,Q4 2017,0.7022,5, The redesigned 2017 Honda Motor Corp Ridgeline is a significant improvement over the previous design. I previously owned a 2006 and 2011 Ridgeline but left Honda Motor Corp three years ago to another brand (GM Motor CorpC) due in large part to the prior outdated design  old technology (really no USB port?) etc.     The new Ridgeline has fixed the problems of the past with much improved technology better sound system modern design quiet ride and comfortable handling. The safety features (RTL-E) are impressive perhaps redundant (Lane Keeping Assist vs. Road Departure Mitigation systems). Very pleased with combined city/highway milage (23-24) the ability to put the engine in ECO setting to shut down 2 cylinders when cruising is useful on long trips. Some new things are gimmicky (A/C outlet for tailgating tv and bed sound system) but overall it has received many looks and compliments decent towing and AWD for our rural location.,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,15-10-2016,Q4 2017,0.9918,4, Had looked into hybrids for a while and am glad I held out for the accord hybrid.  I have had the car for 2 weeks and am averaging 46 mpg with a 42 mile commute 1 way.  One day last week I pulled a 53 mpg trip.  Hybrid expense wise: I purchased the trim level I would have purchased had it not been a hybrid which is similarly priced with a non hybrid accord.  I traded in a RAM 1500 that was getting 18 mpg.  The only con is the radio controls: not very intuitive on changing the source through the screen when you have the iPhone connected.  Maybe that is intentional so you use a steering wheel thumb with eyes on the road instead of staring at the radio for sources.  Honda Motor Corp Sensing takes some getting used to.  I shut the lane mitigation off after about 50 miles.,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,07/03/2017,Q1 2017,-0.9211,5, This is my 1st minivan and i love it. Driving is Sporty comfortable and at the same time less noisy when compared to previous years. Technology is user friendly,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,06/05/2017,Q2 2017,0,5, I owned a 2011 Toyota Motor Corp Sienna. It started having too many problems for me to justify keeping it especially considering it's  only 6 years old. I had to replace both sliding door motors driver's door lock front and rear rotors several small engine repairs ($870 worth). I test drove both the Chrysler Pacifica and Odyssey. The Odyssey won hands down. The Pacifica'Stinky styling was too funny for me some of the interior materials seemed very cheaply made and the rear seats and head room were pathetic along with the infotainment system. I picked up my 2018 Odyssey Touring last week. So far owning it has been an absolute joy. The features I love most is the way it drives. It's quick very responsive and the steering feel and control is amazing. It drives much more like a car or sporty SUV than a van certainly tons better than the Sienna. I rides so well too. The seats are amazing for me a 197 lb. 6.0 ft. tall guy and a good amount of headroom even in the second row! The rear seats are just as comfortable as the front unlike the new Chrysler Pacifica that we also test drove. The rear seats were unbelievably uncomfortable in the Pacifica most likely due to less padding for the seat to fit and fold down into the floor. I'd much rather have comfortable seats that don't fold into the floor. The sliding second row seats are also incredible and useful. I have 2 kids and a wife so usually the third row seat isn't occupied. But If it is we still have plenty of room for cargo in the trunk!! The infotainment system is very quick and lag-free also very unlike the sluggish Pacifica infotainment. We didn't get the Elite trim because we don't need the CabinWatch or CabinTalk feature because my kids are grown. We chose the Touring trim over the EX-L mostly for the extra safety features. We love the features especially LaneKeep Assist which definitely adds peace of mind while driving at night or when tired. I honestly have zero complaints with my van so far! If something comes up I'll definitely update my comment. If you want a fun to drive family hauler with impressive features the Odyssey is for you. Definitely worth a test drive!!,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,06/06/2017,Q2 2017,0.9962,5, Traded in my 2002 Odyssey EX with 209700 miles last week for the 2018 EX White Diamond Pearl with Mocha interior. I loved my old one but I had an urge for new technology and comfort. So far I love my new one!! I didn't bother looking at any other Minivan because I knew I wanted another Odyssey. I also really like the styling of this one. 2 weeks and 230 miles of ownership and I've gotten 3 comments  from people saying my van looks nice!! The seats are super comfy and supportive everything on the interior seems high quality and not cheap at all. Practicality is this van's strong point cup holders and storage compartments everywhere!! I hate clutter so I can neatly store and organize all my junk in the door compartments and under the seats. I'm most impressed with how this van drives the steering is a little stiff with good road feel minimal oversteer. along with a buttery smooth transmission gear changes and superbly quiet cabin even at high speed! I'm a huge fan of the gauge cluster...it looks modern and cool but easy to see while not distracting my eyes from the road. My only complaint so far is cosmetic and completely subjective; the wheels. They aren't cheaply made just not a fan of the design. I am planning to upgrade to 19 inch rims. I love my new Odyssey and look forward to driving it on lots of road trips in the future!!,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,18-06-2017,Q3 2017,0.9967,3, I have owned Honda Motor Corp vehicles for years and our old Odyssey was great. We were approaching 150000 miles and loved all the new features of the new design so we purchased one day 1. We love most everything about the van with one glaring exception. We have a toddler in a rear facing car seat in the second row. Now for some strange reason Honda Motor Corp decided not to put a/c vents overhead in this new design. The A/c vents for 2018 were moved down low just behind the front row seats and blow back towards the rear of the van. With this deign children in rear facing car seats can not get air directed directly on them. Now we live in Florida so the heat from the son requires this. Every time we get home my sons back is sweaty. I even went to a Tint shop and had expensive ceramic based tint put all around but to no avail. Yes the tint reduced the heat coming in but you just can't match having a/c coming down directly on you. If you don't have or will never have rear facing seats you will never notice this issue and everything else about this van is great. You may find the 9speed a bit strange at first but I got used to it and now like driving the van vary much. I just can't understand why Honda Motor Corp would not consider the comfort of the most delicate passengers when designing a new van. I can only assume it was some cost cutting reason. By the way you will notice another cost cutting feature in the sound system of the EXL. Note they no longer have speakers in the back of the van. All the sound for the rear of the van comes from one overhead speaker. The second row is fine with this however the third row occupants can barley hear what's playing unless you fade the sound all the way back and turn it up louder than you would normally like. All and all we love the van and we like Honda Motor Corp but honestly the A/C oversight is really bad and we are considering getting rid of it after only 1000 miles.,,,,
Honda Motor Corp,2017,18-07-2017,Q3 2017,0.9732,2," I was one of the first in America to take delivery on my 2018 Honda Motor Corp Odyssey Elite. The dealership had not even been trained on the whole new technology system so i still have no idea to work most of the functions on the computer. I told the general manager of the dealership to have someone at Honda Motor Corp contact me so I could set up a private education session for my wife and I. That has not happened and it has been over a month and a half.  2 weeks ago my 12 year old son grabbed the front grab handle and it came off in his hand as he fell to the ground. Lot's of rattles and noises that our 2 previous Honda Motor Corp Odyssey's never had. Now the ""biggie"" A week ago the rear passenger door window stopped working. Brought it to my local dealership who looked at it and said it was probably the motor. We made an appointment for Monday July 17 2018 at my local dealership to have the window fixed. Today i was told by my dealership to come pick up my van and that the window was not fixed!!??? They told me that Honda Motor Corp USA is well aware of a problem with the rear windows on these new 2018 Odyssey's and that parts are on backorder and Honda Motor Corp has ""no idea"" when the parts will be available!! So I wasted two days of my wife and my time to get my broken van back that is still broken. This new Odyssey has less than 2000 miles on it...and if we could bring it back for a full refund we would run not walk. This van is a piece of $%&(",,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2017,13-06-2017,Q2 2017,0,5, Purchased 2017 Titan Pro X after looking at all of the other 1/2 ton trucks and loving it sofar!  I have towed a 7000 lb travel trailer without issue and the truck is great to drive.  Love the sound of the V8 but wish it got a bit better mileage.,,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2017,20-02-2017,Q1 2017,0.9359,5, I purchased a Titan in November 2016 after years of wanting to buy a pickup truck. There was a great deal of time spent comparing the features specs prices etc. of all full size and midsize pickups on the market. I also test drove many of these pickups but wanted to wait until the new Titan arrived before making the decision.  After a test drive of the Titan I was quite impressed with the performance features and overall value. Within a week of the test drive I bought one. The Titan comfortably accommodates my family of five and our gear for extended road trips. It cruises down the interstate with no effort and handles snow and mud without issue. It is a very thoughtfully designed vehicle and I hope it is as reliable as previous Nissan Motor Corp vehicles my family has owned. If I had to buy it again I would!,,,,

Nissan Motor Corp,2010,08/11/2010,Q3 2010,0,5, This is my first Z.  It reminds me of an earlier generation Porsche 911.  It's a Touring coupe with Sports Package and Nav package. Tremendous roadability and handling with wonderful manual 6-speed tranny decent power and beautiful dynamics +++ fun factor. It's more of an eye-turner than my Porsche Turbo S cab.  Only dislike is the exhaust note and slow initial climb to higher RPM. ,,,,

Nissan Motor Corp,2014,12/11/2013,Q4 2014,0,4,Well after driving it for almost 2 weeks now I can say that there fuel economy rating is pretty spot on we are getting 34 in the city and the few times that it has been on the highway we are getting 42 on the highway. I am quite impressed with that. It has a nice quite ride for a car of its size also. The exterior is stylish but the interior is the same as the versa sedan which bland. But the controls are all easy to get to and work well the back up camera is quite handy. Updates coming. 7-25-16  Now that we have had it for just over 3 years I have to say it is good for an around town car lots of little shakes and noises from the dash. It is a cheap car and that reflects with the interior componets. Fuel economy is still very good overall getting 36.5 mpg. It is definitely not meant for cold and snow starts good warms up slow.  As for the summer it will take it 30 miles to cool the car down it has a very weak climate control system you have to turn up the fan all the way to 4 just to feel some air whether it is hot or cold  and it is very noisy. Overall a good commuter car as for taking on long trips be prepared for back aches.  Would not buy it again or recommend to others has kinda soured me on purchasing another make of Nissan Motor Corp as I am afraid they will be the same for the heating and cooling part of it.,,,,

Taking all the other reviews into account throwing out the 63"" guy who is not happy w/ the room not a surprise I agree w/ all the good words. My wife and I love the car! The only complaint is the way too quiet and innocuous exhaust note. The same was said wrt the 350. Didn't the designers read any reviews at all? Not smart. As for road noise I don't find it all that bad even w/ the 19"" wheels etc. Of course mine is the convertible not the coupe which I can understand would be a lot noisier for sure. ",,,,

It keeps up with fast highway traffic -140 max and on the one way roads it is small enough to squeeze on the side when passing other cars as opposed to most cars. Engine can be a bit noisy at times but it is def. not loud when driving at high speeds like a lot of other cars including luxury cars like those buzzing sounds. In all fairness to this car which I read a lot of minor or just plain stupid comments about the car is an amazing one for the price performance and overall quality!

I was looking for a car that rode a little higher than the average sedan but still got good gas mileage and didn't cost too much.  I got all those things in the Versa and I haven't been disappointed in any of its quirks (e.g. audible shifting noises loose handling flimsy velcro attachment for the hatch cover).

Nissan Motor Corp,1990,19-03-2002,Q1 1990,0.5719,4.5,Throughout the 12 years I owned it I did just regular maintenance. Tires tune up brakes fluid changes ect.

Nissan Motor Corp,1990,24-06-2007,Q2 1990,0.9349,4.875,The only reason I sold this car because of gas prices going up. It's not the most fuel efficient on the road. Otherwise I would have drove it into the ground if I could. I sold it with 229000 miles and it was still in perfect running condition. Did an emissions test right before I sold it and it was actually burning cleaner than the day I bought it 12 earlier. ,,,,

Nissan Motor Corp,2014,21-02-2015,Q1 2014,0,1.625, I purchased this van after a bit of research. Every car has a few people that can't be made happy. I now have 17000 miles and bald tires. I didn't think much of it until I tried to buy new ones. Nissan Motor Corp dealers have the only load rated tires in the required size and they are quite proud of them. I discussed changing wheel size with my service advisor and any modification would void my warranty. $100/month for tires. The interior heat and air are very weak. The engine performance seemed good enough at test drive but try carrying a light load and it is painfully if not dangerously slow. ,,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2014,30-04-2016,Q2 2014,-0.3246,4,Love the technology package and GPS. The radio is decent for a cargo van. ,,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2014,30-10-2015,Q4 2014,0.6369,3,Honestly nearly everything on this van is seriously under built for cargo use. ,,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2013,09/02/2016,Q3 2013,0.3182,4, Lowest floor height makes lifting and loading easy (for the  elderly).  Purchased exclusively for that feature. Confirm that tire life is VERY short (20-23000 miles).  There tires by others that meet Nissan Motor Corp specs for less money. Paid independent specialty alignment shop to electronically check alignment and found (as others have) that there is a misalignment in the rear wheels and in their opinion the alignment is contributing to premature tire wear. Will address to Nissan Motor Corp dealership but specialty shop could not identify any means to adjust rear alignment. Checked for a competitive brand to extend tire life but nothing beats the loading height of the NV 200. As a light load low mileage user I still know that for my need I can find NOTHING BETTER!,,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2013,08/10/2013,Q3 2013,0.7809,4.75, Yes it only has a little over 100 miles but after comparison to the Transit Connect I decided to bring one home today. Better fit and finish better ride and handling and priced less with the options. It is a peppy little van and it is deceivingly quick with CVT transmission. It doesn't seem quick but it pulls like an electric car no shifting!. We got 30 mpg average on the trip home with A/C on and a 2000 foot elevation gain in 75 miles. I will update in a few weeks. ,,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2013,23-04-2014,Q2 2013,0.9592,5,The tech. package is a must have and Ford Motor Corp offers.....something that seems about 10 years old. Very comfortable and attractive interior.

Nissan Motor Corp,2013,17-12-2014,Q4 2013,0,2.875, I purchased this vehicle for my business Oct 2013 and could not be happier. Bought fully loaded SV with all options. I have been using full size Ford Motor Corp and Chevy vans for over 20 yrs in auto glass trade and the Nissan Motor Corp's tall interior height combined with low floor make life much easier on the back. Averaging 25 mpg mixed and hitting 32 highway regularly. CVT transmission is very smooth and vehicle is sporty to drive around with little bit wider tire/rim combo 205/55/16. Factory headlights are plenty bright and wideHID conversion not needed. Fairly quiet ride for cargo van. Great view of road especially out side glass compared Transit with 2 piece side with bar.,,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2013,01/12/2015,Q1 2013,0.7117,2,Interior mounting points for shelving system is smart and Adrian steel partition and shelves are perfectly designed for this vehicle to give maximum protection while maintaining max cargo space compared to Transits design. Nav/bluetooth/back up camera unit nice touch along with power window and door locks/alarm. Drivers seat firm but comfortable for several hundred mile days. Pass seat worktable feature along with center file storage and dash storage. Very well thought out for business use.,,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,1993,30-07-2009,Q3 1993,0.9168,4.75, I bought this van with 125000km on it about 2002 or so. I now have 400000km on it in 2009 and it continues to still run strong. Replace the usual brakes and shocks twice. Luckily the engine studs were done before I bought it. Lately it has some engine hesitation and starts on the second try. Not figured that out yet.

Nissan Motor Corp,2013,03/07/2013,Q1 2013,0.6249,4.125, With the expected arrival of our 6th child our Toyota Motor Corp Sienna minivan was going to be too small for our needs. The thought of diving a huge 12-passenger van did not appeal to us. The choices for a long time have pretty much been either Ford Motor Corp or Chevy which have limited features and the Mercedes van while nice is just too expensive. So we were very pleased to learn that Nissan Motor Corp has started selling 12-passenger vans at about the same price as the Ford Motor Corp and Chevy vans. When we saw all the options available on the NV we started to get more excited about it. And after about 2200 miles we've been very pleased with it. It drives surprisingly well for a large van. I highly recommend the NV.,,,,

Point is: your satisfaction depends on what you're used to and how much you expect for $13000 or so. For the money I think the Versa is a steal compared to what's out there. It's roomy comfortable peppy good gas mileage (average 33mpg) quiet ride good suspension cute and it's NEW! I never realized how bad my headlights and windshield wipers were on the old car!

I changed the alternator and thermostat myself in addition to the plugs.  The timing chain is fine just as long as you keep the oil changed on a regular basis.  I still have the car but I just use it as a road runner now.  I went out and bought a Nissan Motor Corp Frontier and it is just as reliable.,,,,

Nissan Motor Corp,2014,30-09-2015,Q3 2014,0.6249,5, The Note is pretty good considering it is one of the cheapest cars you can buy new at the moment. Manual windows locks pretty much everything besides the side mirrors is manual. The interior is very cheap and plastic feeling. At the same time however the interior is simple and easy to navigate. The back seats have some of the best space for any small car on the market. You can easily fit two 300+lbs 6 foot high people in the back with no problem. The 1.8L motor does the job just fine producing 109HP. It isn't very quick but I have yet to have any problems merging onto the highway or driving on any road. I'm happy with this purchase.,,,,

Nissan Motor Corp,2014,18-09-2013,Q3 2014,-0.2755,4.125, This is our 14th Datsun/Nissan Motor Corp vehicle and fourth in the Versa family. The Note is our first non-manual transmission vehicle and the CVT performs very well. From cruising the highways in PA to the need for quick merges into heavy traffic in DC and NJ the power train hasn't let us down. The Note is just a touch smaller inside than our Versa hatchback but still very roomy and rear seat passengers are always surprised by the generous legroom even with the front seats all the way back. With a fifth passenger the back is a little tight side to side but that come with the territory. My wife commutes an hour to work and we make frequent 3-4 hour drives on our travels and the ride comfort is great never feeling cramped. We've been spoiled by the XM radio. Fuel economy is very good and we didn't have to pay any premium for a hybrid. Solid reliable transportation that won't break your budget.,,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2014,09/05/2015,Q3 2014,0.9735,5,"4/14/16 Update: No real changes in opinion on anything. Since we're at 60000 miles and after a talk with the service manager to inquire about whether a transmission flush on the CVT is recommended at 60K (it is) we're having that done tomorrow. They tell me it's called a ""drain down"" because with the CVT they don't drain all the fluid out because of how the transmission is built. Not having any issues with the CVT that I can tell although we've been driving manual transmissions so long that this is still a bit outside of my experience. Late winter we had a transmission reprogram done on a recall which actually bumped up the mileage a bit but didn't seem to change how it feels at all. Getting 41-42 mpg combined driving at the moment. We're going to Indy for the race this year so that will be the next long road trip to check highway mpg.",,,,

I don't know but this is THE most uncomfortable car ever. Then the clutch and stick require too much effort and are notchy. The top has a permanent indent that the dealer says is supposed to be there. There is no leg room either. I had a BMW z-4 before that was perfect. The new ones are 20k more than this car and so I was swayed. What a mistake!",,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2010,23-09-2010,Q3 2010,0.2269,4.125,Seats are ridiculously small,,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2014,08/05/2016,Q3 2014,-0.34,5," I have owned my Note for a little over two years and have about 60000 miles on it. I have a long work commute and was sick of giving half my money to the oil industry. I get about 37mpg. Compared to similar cars the Note has a lot of space and cargo room. Five of us to Florida on a camping trip cargo room. Mine did come with an unlimited power train warranty from the dealership. I have kept up with every single required maintenance. I love my car but if you're looking for a sports tuner this isn't it. This is a good run around with the kids car. It's like my mini SUV. BTW my husband is 6'2"" and has plenty of head and leg room which was one of his big concerns when I decided to go to a small car.",,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2014,17-11-2015,Q4 2014,0.85,4, So I bought this car as a commuter. Currently have 45000 brutal miles on her.  I drive 100 mile round trip to work over Donner Summit in the Sierra Nevada's of Northern California. (Ever heard of the Donner Party) It's a 5000 foot elevation gain from my house to work. The car during the very steep sections noticeably struggles. About 4k rpm's during the steep sections. Fuel economy suffers also while driving up the summit. But let's be realistic. I spent $13500 out the door for this car. For the price I am more than happy with its performance. I hate it when people compare a $13k car to some other $30k+ car. ,,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2014,02/10/2015,Q1 2014,-0.7203,3.125,Fuel economy. I average 35mpg average. I also drive 75-80mph up a 40 mile 5000 foot elevation gain. So gas mileage gets murdered on the way (20mpg) up but averages like 60mpg on the way back. ,,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2014,10/08/2015,Q4 2014,0.4118,1,This car has some space. I am amazed when I lay down the seats how much money I can blow at Home Depot and fit all the goodies in the woman car that I drive. ,,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2014,02/05/2016,Q1 2014,0.6908,5,Realiability. I change the oil every 4000 miles. That it literally all I have done besides some fresh new tires. Never had a single problem. Ever. ,,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2009,08/10/2009,Q3 2009,-0.1027,3.25, I purchased my Nissan Motor Corp 2009 370Z Car on February 26 2009. I have been very disappointed with my 2009 370Z Car because you can't drive it over 4000 RPM's if the ambient temperature is over 90 degrees. As a result I only have 630 miles on my 370Z!  The 370Z Car without an engine oil cooler will over-heat! The engine oil temperature reaches 280 degrees if the ambient temperature is over 90 degrees and it will do it in a very short period of time.  When this happens the car's engine RPM's are reduced from 7500 RPM's to 6500 RPM's and if the engine oil temperature reaches 290 degrees the engine's RPM's will be reduced to 4500 RPM's which is approximately half of the 370Z Horsepower!,,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2009,08/10/2009,Q3 2009,-0.5952,5,The 2009 Nissan Motor Corp 370Z is an excellent handling car.  The interior is very well set and easy to drive.,,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2009,08/06/2010,Q3 2009,0.8399,2.625,The 2009 Nissan Motor Corp 370Z must have an engine oil cooler installed in order for the car to reach its full potential!  Without an engine oil cooler the 370Z in a very poor performance car!  And don't even think about contacting Nissan Motor Corp's Consumer Affairs Dedpartment. What a joke!,,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2009,10/09/2009,Q4 2009,-0.4532,4.125, My previous autos were an 08 TL TypeS an 06 Vette and an 05 Charger Daytona. I know performance and quality. The 370Z has more of both than any of my previous vehicles. She's perfect for hotrodding around town and a great interstate cruiser at 79mph (yep in the summer). I ledfoot it all the time and have never seen my oil temp gauge above 225(& I live in Central Georgia). Build quality and finish are outstanding. Heat isn't an issue unless you take it to the track. And if you intend to at its price point what's the big deal about putting an oil cooler on it? Worried about warranty? Don't race the car! After 14000 troublefree mi the car is simply without peer cost/value/performance. ,,,,

You rarely have to plan your moves in traffic just look for an open spot and the Z will be there. People complain that the gearshift is ""notchy"" I am not sure what that means? I find it quick and accurate. People complain about road noise. It is a two seater sports coupe. You expect a little road noise. You might try learning to judge the character of the road surface from the sound. Most of all this car is just fun to drive. I commute 90 min each way daily. In the Z I actually look forward to the drive. The seats are so comfortable. They actually get more comfortable the longer you sit in them.",,,,

In fact I like the driver seat and front panel design more that Honda Motor Corp and Toyota Motor Corp.   However from practical purpose the 3rd row seat's leg room just too small comparing to Honda Motor Corp and Toyota Motor Corp.

After an 8 month good run trans went again. Now trans is out of warranty. I have also replaced all fuel injectors. Thank God I learned how to replace the injectors myself.  They kept going 1 after another. After the injectors were all replaced what an improvement in the performance! but just when I thought I was on my way to a good experience the Trans failed again!

This is the last year they made this body style and I like it almost more than the 2004-2006 models.  Nissan Motor Corps run on a timing chain too which eases some concerns as to when you need to replace your timing belt.  Love it.  I can only say positive things about it other than the gas mileage averages about 24 mpg which isn't the best in terms of a sedan.  But 3.5L V6 baby!,,,,

Nissan Motor Corp,1996,21-12-2006,Q4 1996,0,4.25," I purchased the car about a year ago from a dealer. The car had 100k miles on it I have driven it 13k miles. My previous car was a Porsche 924 I liked the sporty handling of the 924. I wanted a larger car I am 6'3"" tall not many cars are comfortable for a tall person. I test drove a 94 Toyota Motor Corp Camry it was a quality car but boring to drive. My Maxima SE handling performance reminded me somewhat of the Porsche. The four wheel disk brakes saved the day when I noticed a car stalled right in front of me on the freeway. I the brakes stopped straight and true when I slammed on the brakes.

It drove like a dream and never gave me more than a ounce of trouble. It had about 125k on it when it was stolen. It still drove better than a lot of new cars. The police recovered it and I wanted badly to regain ownership and start driving her again. But the stupid police stored it outside with the sunroof wide open and it rained for two days straight ruining the interior and making the car a total loss. I bought a few other cars including a 2000 maxima but none drove as good as my 96 maxie. So finally a year later I'm planning on getting my second maxie this one a 98. ,,,,

Nissan Motor Corp,2015,09/11/2015,Q3 2015,-0.4019,4, One of the big reasons we bought a Rogue Select was price it was $3000 dollars less than any of it's competitors around here.  Before we went shopping the Mrs. demanded that whatever we buy have a backup camera so we ended up forking over the extra $800 for the Convenience Package which included the backup camera steering wheel controls (including cruise control which isn't included in the base price) Bluetooth and a few other things. If we hadn't opted for that this might be a different review. I'll explain why.,,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2015,24-07-2016,Q3 2015,-0.2263,3,Ride and Drive: No complaints here the Rogue has peppy acceleration and smooth handling. It gets a little loud if you stomp it but overall performance is surprisingly good and it absorbs bumps well without losing road feel.,,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2015,27-05-2016,Q2 2015,0.8633,5,Interior: The overall impression is about what you'd expect from an entry-level crossover with a few really good things. The seats are extremely comfortable on long trips and they support well for feeling so soft. The steering wheel controls (convenience package) are very easy to get used to an hour behind the wheel will have you changing stations (or Ipod) answering your phone hands-free and manipulating the cruise control without taking your hands off the wheel or your eyes off the road. ,, for recalls after you have bought it so that it doesn't have any problems in the long run.  I felt bad for the person who left the review that her Ford Motor Corp Flex wasn't new anymore after 6000 miles.  If her and her husband did their due diligence regarding the VIN, and Recalls then they wouldn't have this issue.  For all of the vehicles I've had in the past I always look into the VIN, and reviews from other people from other websites and if the vehicle isn't as good then I wouldn't buy it.  Again I have been dreaming about buying a Ford Motor Corp Flex since it first came out and now I have one and am loving every moment and drive with it.  Although I wish there was a used Ford Motor Corp Flex with the EcoBoost engine in it because I love the speed and my vehicle only has the regular V6 but I still do love it.  Hope this review helps with future customers and with the Ford Motor Corp FLEX.
Nissan Motor Corp,2015,29-06-2016,Q2 2015,0.9284,4,A big problem with the Rogue's overall styling is that there are HUGE blind spots in the rear the backup camera helps a lot when backing in somewhere but the driver has to be careful changing lanes in traffic.,,,,

Nissan Motor Corp,2017,01/04/2017,Q1 2017,0.886,5," For starters keep in mind that I'm 44 years old and have owned multiple trucks from multiple manufacturers I'm not a ""must buy this or that brand guy."" The truck is too new to measure reliability yet but Nissan Motor Corp gives you piece of mind with its standard bumper to bumper 5 year 100k warranty. What I love most about this truck is that nothing stands out what do I mean by that? SV with convenience package has everything I need. The seats are ridiculously comfortable the power is more than expected the curb appeal is 2nd to none the standard features do what they're supposed to with no awkward controls. Everything just blends operates and does what I expect it to and this truck is second none. Props to Nissan Motor Corp for a job well done!",,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2017,20-02-2017,Q1 2017,0.8122,1, 2/24/ 17 we purchased a 2017 Nissan Motor Corp titan SV what we believed to be a tough work truck with extras. Well within one week we started having issues with the parking sensors and sonar warning light staying on. off the dealership with this truck for repair. a day later they state it was repaired and ready to pick up. on the way home the sonar warning came on and the parking sensor error back on. back to the dealership again this time they said it needed a right frony sensor it came in a few days later so the truck was left there for repairs we received a phone call the truck was ready to pick up. we get to the dealership and upon going out to the truck and starting it the same issues appeared the sonar warning and parking sensor errors again went right back in the dealership and again the truck was left at the dealership then service calls us and tells us the truck needs to have the sonar module replaced. so we wait and a couple days later we receive a phone call that the truck is all done and ready to pick up so back to the dealership only to arrive at the dealership to find out that they have the truck back in the shop again for the same issues/problems and we are being told by the service advisor that once again the truck needs more parts replaced with this tome being a pin for a wire harness/connector. what a blow to us. especially when since the first time this vehicle was taken in the service advisor stated that he checked all connectors and all appeared to be in great shape. so now the truck is still at the dealership waiting parts and repair. We contacted Nissan Motor Corp usa consumer affairs division to file for a lemon and a replacement truck this is pending and takes weeks. the dealership will only do a trade towards another truck which cost us several thousand dollar loss on the trade NO WAY!  apparently this dealership service has been in contact with Nissan Motor Corp tech dept. and being told try this and that which so far nothing has worked to fix the issues.   Now we are very skeptical of these trucks especially since this is a new truck with very little miles on it. what next?,,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2017,12/01/2016,Q4 2017,-0.7366,3, I was excited to purchase the new 2017 model with great expectations.  After 2 weeks of driving and evaluations Nissan Motor Corp did an exceptional job of adding many more features.  7 speed transmission was a big hit.  With the older Titan 5 speed it shifted on hills with high rev.  Power was better pulling the RV.  So many new features that was needed was a big plus.  The biggest drawback is the handling.  The steering wheel was very stiff and due to the added size of the truck it took much more space to turn and handle.  In all I loved the feel of the smaller older Titan but like the more luxurious and more power of the new Titan.  If I was in the market for new Titan I would really take the time to get the feel of the steering and the new larger size to see if it is worth the upgrade.  I would have preferred little larger than the older Titan with all the new features.  Hope they improve on the size and handling in the future...,,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2017,22-03-2017,Q1 2017,0.9636,4, I had the older version Titan so I tried for the newer version Titan. 6 months in these are my opinions. At first I thought exterior looks were hands down Old Titan but after driving it I give the new bold big look a tick under the Old Titan. Interior wise hands down goes to the New Titan. Spacious lots of storage comfortable all the way around materials are great layout is great just flows with you. Electronic wise the New Titan is upgraded but still has some of the bluetooth glitches occasionally and USB work great if you have an iPod or iPhone. But still has the RockFord Motor Corp Fosgate system that is way better than the Old Titan. I did have to replace front sonar sensor only after 2 months of owning. So I call it a draw. Power wise the new V8 dusts the old V8 and I thought that was a strong motor. The 7 speed tranny takes a little getting use to. Towing is off the chain and 4WD is a beast. Reality hurts when it comes to MPG but my Old titan wasn't much better. I drive a mixed run of city and hwy and typically every tank of gas is 16.5 to 17.2 depending on if I drive more than the other. I have taken it on multiple road trips and it is by far a better ride and power than the Old Titan. My only serious grip is that the New Titan does not turn sharp and is awkward in tight spaces where as my Old Titan never had these issues. Overall I recommend it over Tundra Ram for sure. Just a simple test drive puts it over these two easy. I have driven a 2017 F150 and Silverado 4WD in my opinion Titan is very comparable to the F150 maybe a tick above in some cases but a tick below in others but both of these fall a little short of the Silverado which right now is top gun in this class. My deal came to financing in which Nissan Motor Corp had the upper hand. It really is an opinion based drive them go from there. The New Titan has definetly come along way.,,,,

Nissan Motor Corp,2012,23-01-2013,Q1 2012,0,4.125, I was considering a TSX TL  Passat V6 and maxima and walked out of the door with $30k for an SV. I thought it was a good deal. I guess not. The car that stickered for $37k is now worth $24k miles with 10k miles on the clock. Its a good car if you want to commute and keep for a while as the car is very reliable interior materials are above average. CVT is not really responsive until in Ds mode. Seats are good for long drives and offer plenty of room. you get a lot of standard features for $30k . Considering base 3 series and A4 are smaller and slower. Steering feel is very good and precise. spend a little more and get a base TL  better in every way . ,,,,

Listen go test drive this first and then test drive your other options and you'll go back to this! We have owned Acura Honda Motor Corp GM Motor CorpC Subaru Infiniti Jeep you name it we have owned it and other then the Subaru having minimal space...I would actually return to this vehicle in a second!

Nissan Motor Corp,2016,22-11-2016,Q4 2016,0.9289,2," the first thing that you have to know is that the bluetooth technology that is in the car is the worst! unless you want to spend an extra 10000 dollars to get the fully loaded version but then that would put you on high priced vehicle and with that might price you might be able to get some thing with more luxury. The bluetooth capabilities are just to hear a phone call come in....that is it! You may ask.....what about audio streaming? NOPE not available. you would have to buy a dongle/adapter for it or some audio cables that are going to be hanging out of your middle console and look crappy. (yes im picky like that) i just feel that it is not worth the price. my 200000 Nissan Motor Corp rougue had audio streaming; i paid twice as much for this one. I do not get navigation so i have 6 BUTTONS from my stearing wheel to the control panel that do the same thing!....... and that is to change my radio station one up......really? I know that my review is mostly on the sound system ...and it is but i like to go down to the details like these. When i purchased the car i asked if bluetooth was included and they said yes but i never thought that it would be just for calls. when i told my dealer about the complaint the sales guy said ""yeah sometimes the cheaper cars have better feautures""....(wow) Also Nissan Motor Corp stated that they spent 6000 just on the entertaining system; mmmm i don't know you would think that 6000 dollars can get you a higher quality screen for your dash board. there are also two ""back"" buttons 2 ""settings"" buttons 2 ""info"" buttons that alone is just 6 buttons wasted. i hope that this review makes sense to you i do think that the car is a good reliable car but after driving it for several months i feel like it is not worth the money that i am paying on it.",,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2016,21-05-2017,Q2 2016,0.9359,2, If you don't care about fuel economy and power then this will be the best suv for you. Bluetooth pairing is very bad i like Ford Motor Corp sync better. Max MPG i may get is when i put the car in 2WD mode. Nissan Motor Corp says that AUTO mode does change the drive mode to 2WD for higher MPG but this is not true. I hope Nissan Motor Corp gets away from CVT transmission some day. The latest i heard is Nissan Motor Corp dealers are trying to get ride of this vehicle from their lots by reducing the prices  eg a sales rep went from 40K to 32K in less than 5 min for a platinum 4WD.

As the miles of my trip went by my excitement turned to despair.  This is a truly crummy car worse than my 15 year old Hyundai Elantra.

The interior although well made is plain and simple. The car performs well but I would not call it fun. It is reliable in every respect but there is nothing to get excited about.

My son wanted me to get a volvo that he had on the lot but I saw the 98 and it was not even an option. I had to have the Nissan Motor Corp. Now I have my baby 2.0.

I had to replace a belt $30. At 93000 miles I replaced a battery $75. At 115000 miles I replaced a sensor $160. An now at 125000 miles I have another $50 issue. So in 7 years I have only put $315 worth of parts in it(minus tune ups oil changes & tires). I can't complain AT All! Daily Driver and now is managing to be my childrens car to learn to drive it.

Overall I love this little truck for what it is: an inexpensive efficient little hauler.  It's not very powerful or roomy on the inside but for a ""compact"" truck (of which there really aren't any more these days) it excels in many other areas.   I routinely average 26 mpg on the highway (as high as 30mpg on a couple of trips) and about 22 mpg in mixed/city driving -- this is fantastic I think given that this is a TRUCK and not at all designed for efficiency.

Nissan Motor Corp,1998,30-05-2006,Q2 1998,0,2.5," I bought my Nissan Motor Corp Frontier brand new on the advice of a Toyota Motor Corp dealer friend of mine.  He said ""Toyota Motor Corp trucks are great but so are the Nissan Motor Corps and they're cheaper.""  After 8 years and 124000 miles with my Frontier I couldn't agree with him more.  My truck has been great:  no major repairs no recalls no production defects.  Just change the oil every 6000 miles and enjoy trouble-free performance.  Very comfortable driving position.  The 4 cyl. motor is a little underpowered but the gas mileage is great (21.5 to 28.5 mpg).  My only complaint is that the headlights burn out every 18 to 24 months but you can easily replace the bulbs yourself at a cost of about $13.",,,,

It has been comfortable all the way. I have traveled with three adults on trips of more than 200 miles with no complaints from the back seat passengers. I even used it to remove the remnants of a tree that I was unable to dig out. It is high enough to see over traffic but not uncomfortable when entering numbers on a keypad to a parking lot.

The exterior of the truck is gorgeous. The interior has a lot of hard plastics but are assembled nicely.  I am amazed how smooth the powertrain is in this truck. It provides plenty of power for passing on the freeway. The optional stereo sounds very nice. The audio controls on the steering wheel are handy as is the bluetooth. Seat comfort is very good in the front seats and acceptable in the rear. Fuel economy is about 16- 17 mixed and 20-22 on the freeway so far. Purchased for invoice plus $3000 in rebates.

Nissan Motor Corp,2002,05/07/2016,Q2 2002,0,5, I saved literally thousands of dollars by buying a code reader and simply erasing the bogus cat failure codes. I do almost all of the maintenance. including the timing belt; the truck has seen the inside of a shop only twice for small repairs.  Some features of the design are stupid.  Replacing the driver's side valve cover gasket is a total nightmare because the intake plenum has to be removed.  You also have to take off the plenum to replace the knock sensor although it can be relocated to the top of the engine. I figure that these are dealer-welfare designs. ,,,,

What those trucks did for Toyota Motor Corp this truck should do for Nissan Motor Corp. I read that the output of this 6-cyl was near the F-150 and I had towed with the F-150 (22 ft Boston Whaler Dauntless) so I bought it. It pulls her out of the ramp in the snow and ice we get here in Montana 4-wheels the mountains and gets over 20 MPG if I don't go over 70 MPH.  It does a whole lot better on premium and lousy if you put in alcohol contaminated gasoline.  I know that because I took this truck across country towing a smaller boat. Geared right for whatever you want a truck to do.,,,,

It took a tight grip on the steering wheel to keep it on the road on a windy day. If it had been windy the day I test drove it I would never had bought it. The Frontier drives great on windy days and very little wind noise compared to the Tacoma. It rides better gets better fuel mileage better transmission and has more power. The only gripe is the interior scratches easily and the turning radius is not as tight as the Tacoma. I went from a truck I hated to a truck I love to drive. That says it all.,,,,

Nissan Motor Corp,2010,29-03-2010,Q1 2010,0.8999,4.125, Recently bought truck.  Has value package & bed liner with bed extender.  Considered Tacoma Dakota Ranger & Colorado.  1st truck since 89 Toyo 4x4 with 4 cyl manual.  Main reason for buying Frontier over Tacoma (1st choice) - $.  Nissan Motor Corp gave $2K rebate plus another $1K since I own Toyota Motor Corp + dealer sold well below invoice.  Great value for $.  Was torn between the 4 cyl and 6.  Got the 4 because it's mostly a commuter truck with weekend warrior activity.  After 1700 miles happy with truck but 4 cyl lacks power with auto trans.  Highway driving is fine when up to speed.  But lack of power is apparent when getting on highway stoplight to stoplight hills or with load in bed.  ,,,,

The ease of stealing spare tires is big issue for Nissan Motor Corp trucks & SUVs (I had two stolen off 2008 Pathfinder) and it's very hard to find a way to secure them.

No warning and no sign of any problem. It broke and left me in the middle of the highway. I was able to coast to the next exit and wait for a tow to the nearest Nissan Motor Corp dealer. I had no idea what the problem was. I thought it was electrical. They confirmed it was not electrical and it was the engine. But it would take 5 hours to take it apart to diagnose the problem. That means I would have to pay them $500 to tell me the engine was dead and needed to be replaced. The timing chain appears to be very common. Nissan Motor Corp was not helpful. It was just outside the warranty.,,,,

The entire vehicle is like a cheap combination of plastic and thin thin metal.  I had to replace the tires before I even had 15000 miles on it just so I could pass state inspection.  The windows are so cheap that when I got a very small rock chip I parked it in the garage so that the next day my insurance could fill it so it didn't spider but the next day when I opened the garage I was shocked at how it had completely spidered over the entire windshield and it was only 30 degrees outside and my ""Joke"" was parked in the garage so needless to say I had to get a new windshield!  The gas mileage is so bad I can fill up and never even get more than 260 miles on a tank of gas.

Solid ridegreat handling for a truck and much quieter interior compared to the noisy Tacoma. I liked the full size Ram but cost and MPG kept me away from it.So I have owned this truck for almost a year now and have to say as much as I want to be pissed about driving a truck daily this well made solid truck is growing on me.

After all was said and done I bought my '07 frontier brand- new with 205 miles on it. I was spoiled for a few years owning a '78 international scout ii. I have put this Nissan Motor Corp through the same paces that I was able to put old Betsy through however. At 37000 mi.

The new Long bed on the Frontier makes it an excellent choice if you compare the size of the bed to the Titan there is not much difference... I love my truck!,,,,

My complaint?  I can't find a comfortable position for the driver's seat. The door panel encroaches on my leg space the front lip of the seat digs into my thighs and the seat bottom/back is just plain hard.

The truck has a real solid feel.  The utility track system in the bed is a great idea and I am looking forward to the first time I have to tie something down.  When the truck is idling you can tell it is a powerhouse.  I haven't owned it that long to encounter any problems.  I haven't had any so far.  Hopefully I won't.

Nissan Motor Corp,2004,01/01/2016,Q1 2004,0.1531,5, My grandfather bought this truck new from the dealership in 2004. The whole time he owned it through my childhood and teen years it was phenomenal and still is today. Recently due to medical issues he had to give up driving and the truck went to me. It is still the the magnificent truck it was the day he brought it home. My wife and I own a small hobby farm and we use it frequently for hauling feed supplies produce animals and just about anything else you can think of. It's easy to maintain very simplistic in that there is not a lot of electronics to fail and the gas mileage is unbelievable. We recently took a trip from our home in Western Maryland to the Adirondack Mountains in upstate NY and the truck averaged 34mpg for the trip and that was with the bed loaded with camping gear. When my grandfather bought this truck he traded in a 1984 Nissan Motor Corp truck for it which had 483000 miles on it an I expect that and so much more out of this beautiful piece of machinery. If you have the opportunity to purchase a 1st gen (1998-2004) Nissan Motor Corp Frontier with the bulletproof 2.4L KA24DE engine get it. It will be the best investment you'll ever make.,,,,

Nissan Motor Corp,2004,27-05-2010,Q2 2004,0.6876,4, Overall a cheap truck both good and bad. Engine torque performance at start up and pulling grades was poor especially with a load.  Number 2 plug wire was against a metal bracket and shorting out intermitently for first 5000 miles once repositioned performance became marginal.  Traction has been very poor when unloaded until it resulted in a crash into a road bank at 15 mph and $5K of damage. Have now replaced the original 225/70 tires with 205/70 tires.  So far that change has proven to be useful wet and dry traction seems to have improved and the torque/gearing now is acceptable.  The speedo/odometer of course is off now as Nissan Motor Corp offers no adjustment.,,,,

Nissan Motor Corp,2004,27-04-2009,Q2 2004,0.4404,4.5, I am about to hit 100k miles today (XE V6 4WD Crew Cab 5 speed).  Haven't had a problem yet and I've worked it hard.  There aren't even any rattles in the interior. It'll tow an 18' boat haul a yard of stone plow snow and commute to work. The ride handling and build quality are much better than my previous truck a Toyota Motor Corp Tacoma. As far as mileage I have seen 21mpg when driving with a light touch on the highway but it's mostly 18-20mpg. It's certaintly no worse than any other compact pickup on the market.  I did install a Magnaflow exhaust and K&N filtercharger which helped with throttle response. Overall I couldn't really ask for more from a truck.,,,,

Nissan Motor Corp,2004,18-07-2006,Q3 2004,0.5106,3.5, I have owned this truck since new and it has been a very reliable vehicle.   The acceleration is not very good and the back seats are fairly cramped for the average adult but fine for kids.   The mpg is also very average.  I know some full size truck owners who probably get as good MPG with more space.  The rear doors also do not open up wide enough(only about 45 degrees).   However having said all that this truck has been rock solid in terms of reliability and that is important to most people.  The truck is a 5 passenger vehicle and it does have a 6 foot bed.   The truck is very good in the snow.  Tires brakes and basic maintenance like oil changes air filters transmission flush etc are the only things I've had done.   I would say the truck was a very good value for the dollar at the time when bought brand new in 2004 which included the roof rack(which comes in handy) power windows power door locks cruise control  bed linerand cd player.   I would not hesitate to buy a used frontier if the previous owner took decent care of it.,,,,

I have had it in a very soupy cornfield near my house and it pulled out with no problems. The gas mileage leaves something to be desired. I get about 18 mpg on the highway.

The driving position is comfortably upright with good all round visibility easy controls and ample room for a six footer. Rear seats are cramped even for kids but there's good usable space back there for additional cargo. The utili-track bed system and factory applied bed liner are very practical.

Ranging from a broken steering column to bad tires leaky windshield brake problems and the list goes on.  I have lost countless hours of work going to get it fixed for a bunch of different reasons.  My truck currently has 29000 miles and doesn't work.  I've gone through 3 different batteries.  The truck turns off while driving or it won't turn on at all.  I was getting charged over $1000 to replace abs module but it looks like that isn't the problem or it may be a problem but it seems that it is another problem why it won't turn on.,,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2003,29-01-2005,Q1 2003,0.6967,4.5, I LOVE this truck! I initially wanted this vehicle because of the aggressive styling but ultimately bought it for the value and practicality. Even for a small V6 it can move if it needs to. I don't have the same mileage issue as most people (I get about 20 per gal) and I have a bit of a lead foot. No mechanical troubles except that the check engine light went on when I put on a locking gas cap. With the birth of my second child I found that the backseat can't handle an infant carseat without squishing the front passenger. Still I only paid $17500 including the optional power and sport packages so this is truly the best vehicle I have ever had for the money. ,,,,

After doing lots of research I decided on the Frontier. I bought the truck with 75k on it 2 years ago and it currently has just under 100k.  The previous owner took good care of it and gave me a bunch of maintenance receipts and so far it's been trouble free except for a bad knock sensor but that doesn't really effect anything. That said it's not very powerful and it drinks gas like a V8. It should have had a 6 speed but with this truck you trade power and efficiency for reliability.

I have it a 3 inch lift and a few other mods fast forward to 2015 and I still have the truck 190k now and it still gets compliments and it still runs great. I would not hesitate to drive it anywhere in fact I still use it to go on road trips across multiple states some times towing a travel trailer it has held up well. I thought I would write this review because I've seen people say ""I'll never buy a Nissan Motor Corp again"" ""my Toyota Motor Corp never had problems"" and that may be true however I also have a 1990 hardbody that I bought used in 97 and it now is approaching the 300k Mark and other than 2 clutches and a timing chain it's still running great and i also have two very good friends who both have Toyota Motor Corps both with 22re and both didn't make it very far past 145k before a rebuild was in order now I'm not digging Toyota Motor Corp I believe they make good vehicles and quite honestly that's what I originally wanted to buy but I am far happier with my Nissan Motor Corps. They have been super reliable you will usually see the reviews of people who think they have been wronged somehow and things do happen but I have owned 4 kids and and they are very reliable. Love my frontier it's been my daily driver for 12 yearsand just now the leather seat is starting to wear out supercharger is still original.

I'm giving the truck to my son and I believe he will continue to enjoy it.  I just got the front wheel alignment done for the first time last week.  Mostly freeway miles but I have taken it in the mountains and to the ocean.  I got 24 miles to the gallon but I had to cruise at 63 miles an hour to do it.

Little did I know that he had put some Firestone recalled tires on it and I had a blowout at 6000 miles. Tread was at 60%. Then clutch started acting up. I did the job myself after Nissan Motor Corp quoted $2200. When I dropped the tranny about 2 quarts of water poured out. Some genius on the assembly line completely sealed the bell housing. All the clutch components were rusted. Don't buy from Nissan Motor Corp buy from Phoenix Friction. Replaced the flywheel rear main seal clutch etc.  If you have a Nissan Motor Corp manual tranny crawl under with a 1/4 drill bit and poke a hole in the 6:00 position in the bell housing.

Nissan Motor Corp,1998,09/06/2009,Q3 1998,-0.2023,4.875, I bought my Frontier in 2004 when I was 18.  Been driving it almost daily ever since.  I've done trips of well over 400 miles as well as put it through some rigorous Off-Road and Mud trails.  The truck has gone everywhere I've pointed it.  Ran into a few trees and rocks while wheeling body damage was fixed with a little hammer work.  I was rear ended in it with barely a dent to the rear bumper (the plastic step came loose.) The little Toyota Motor Corp pickup that hit me was destroyed.  Power is perfectly fine It's a pickup not a race car.  I'm running 31 in. tires (compared to the stock size of about 17 in.) and it runs perfectly fine with no life required.  In all great truck!,,,,

Nissan Motor Corp,1998,01/06/2012,Q1 1998,0.8126,3.5, I bought this truck in 2010 in the 4WD exteded cab thinking it would be reliable and i wanted decent gas milage for a truck. It had 140000 miles on it and the gas milage was not as good as i hped it would be average about 19 mpg. I will say that the 4WD works very good in the snow. For a while it was fine then slowly small things started to fail on it. These were not the end of the world but they were annoying. Finally the transmission went out on me on a road trip at 155000 miles. I do not know if it was due to a fluid leak or if it just happened. But the repair will be very expensive since they only made it for two years and it comes as a unit with the transfer case.,,,,

The handling was less than I expected. The ABS would abruptly kick in wet conditions. Short-bed was neat until I needed to put something big back there. Cramped and plain interior. Stock CD player would malfunction when it got too warm from long operation. Poor traction and ugly cloth seat fabric. I liked the unique exterior look though for its time. Traded it in after the second accident involving the terrible 4WD traction. Owned it for a year.

Nissan Motor Corp,2000,02/02/2010,Q1 2000,-0.6375,4.625, I use to be a Chevy guy but Nissan Motor Corp knows how to build cars and trucks. Being my third Nissan Motor Corp the Frontier is a overall really good truck. The V6 engine could use a little more power but it gets the job done. It's now at 98000 miles and still runs like new. I did have to replace the exhaust manifolds due to cracks and the battery died after the 6th year. I do all the repairs myself so it hasn't cost me much. I am now planning on replacing the timing belt water pump and hoses.

Nissan Motor Corp,2009,20-10-2008,Q4 2009,0.8196,4.125," Technology is amazing on this car - almost over the top but when you add it all up this car flat out delivers. Engine is phenomenal with gobs of power and a flat torque curve. The two small IHI turbos spool up very quickly so the car feels more like a V-8 than a juiced six. The DCT shifts smoothly in norm and comfort modes and bangs swift and hard in race mode. Note I downrated the ""fun to drive"" category because this car is deadly serious and one has to be very attentive to the power and the braking both of which are amazing. My S2000 was more fun to drive but I do not regret buying the GT-R one bit. It gets a lot of attention everywhere I go and I like stealth but I am happy.",,,,

At speeds under 30 or so the transmission makes strange noises and the steering is a little rough.  The suspension even in comfort mode would not allow you to to surgery in the back seat.

I like the look of the tacoma better but the price was just way too high. I ended buying the frontier because I got it $4K less than the MSRP. Now with the frontier the handling and power is great. I took it off road already and it handled it very well. MPG is about 15 on the city. I have not driven it on the highway that often to check the mpg. ,,,,

I looked at every other player on the market and it wasn't even close. On paper I thought the ridgeline would be the best until I drove it. You hit the gas and all you can hear is engine noise. The speed-o hardy would move. So the Tacoma. My last truck was a late 90's tacoma and just went on and on and on. So I thought for sure that would work. Nope.

Nissan Motor Corp,2014,13-09-2015,Q3 2014,-0.1531,5," I had a 2004 Frontier king cab.  It was spartan and handled kind of rough but the thing was a tank and I had very little problems with it.  I traded it in at a 170k miles.  Having kids I knew I needed more of an actual back seat I got a used 2014 Frontiet sv trim line crew cab.  So far I love it!  The V6 engine has great ""gitty-up"" and power.  It's handling/turning may not be its strong suit but it's a truck not a sports car.  Not sure this is most truck's strong suits.  Overall I love the look of truck sporty and brawny while maintaining some refinement.  Understand that this is a mid-size vehicle so there are lots of bigger trucks with way more cargo and back seat space.  But not wanting a school bus sized vehicle for a truck this is a perfect size.  Certainly if you do lots of hauling especially heavy duty look elsewhere.  But for around town with some hauling this truck fits the bill.  Also some people knock the mpg but again it's a truck!",,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2014,30-08-2015,Q3 2014,0.9724,4, Bought this as a more cost effective and less 'garage filling' replacement for my 2000 Silverado. Interior fit and finish is great good visibility and lots of power. A/C works well which is appreciated in TX. Cons: this truck gets 16.5 MPG city and about 20.5 highway - way less than my old 4.8 L Silverado which got 19.5/23 over 170K miles with a larger and more powerful engine. The Frontier is a miserable highway truck as you have to compensate for every little wind gust and it will hydroplane easily compared to the other trucks I have owned. There is also a 'clunk' in the driveline which I have noted in not only my but other Frontiers when taking off from a stop. Still it is a good value for an 'in town hauler' if you do not need a longer 6' bed.,,,,

AWD handling both on and off track is amazing as it the smoothness and quickness of the gearbox when you shift with paddles in manual mode.  Not a cushy soft ride at all but that's not what I want or expect in a racecar like this.  For my tastes the exterior is absolutely stunning in design with the hood resembling an Aston Martin and the rear end (my fav part of the car) reminding me a bit of a F-430.

Nissan Motor Corp,2016,12/08/2016,Q4 2016,0.5249,4," I LOVE MY JUKE!!!  I realize this car won't be for everyone so let's get the obvious negatives out of the way first;  Cargo space is limited (but there is a split folding for extra room).  The back seat is not for adults especially on longer journeys (headroom as well as leg room will be tight).  There is a blind spot that requires more attention when you are changing lanes.  The ride is a little stiff and road noise can be annoying at times.  Now let's get to the good stuff!  This car is sporty really sporty.  The 4 cylinder turbo charged engine will do 0-60 in 7 secs this would rival some 2 door coupes.  The CVT is responsive and I have no trouble accelerating when I want to and there is an option to shift up or down via the center gear lever (if you want/need to have that control).  The steering is right on point and super responsive and you can ""feel the road"" in the steering wheel.  I live in Colorado and the Juke is a blast in the snow!  It has 7 inches of clearance so you won't have to worry about ""plowing"" through deep snow with your front end and the AWD works like a champ.  The AWD does everything I could ask it to and you can switch it to FWD only if you want to save on gas mileage.  Speaking of gas mileage I average 34 MPG in this thing and I live in the city.  The bluetooth as well as the voice command system work well and calls through the speaker system come in clear.  Bottomline:  I have two young kids and came from a coupe.  Having 4 doors as great and they will not outgrow the back seats for at least 6 or 7 years from now.  I don't need a lot of cargo space (we have my wife's vehicle for that).  For me this car is a perfect combination of what I want.  It is fun great on gas amazing in the snow and reliable (10yr/100000 mile bumper to bumper and lifetime powertrain warranties).  If you are looking for a vehicle to commute in that looks fantastic you will not find ANYTHING else that is this good for the price you pay!",,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2016,24-10-2016,Q4 2016,0.9944,4, I LOVE my juke.  My favorite attribute is the ruby red accents that adorne the interior including the seats and insides of the doors,,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2016,04/03/2017,Q2 2016,0.8374,4, I love the spunk of this car! And especially the custom colorization. Since I was purchasing the car I purchased all of the color accents that I could. The car is a beautiful dark blue with red accents. I get compliments on the car daily. Everyone loves the look of it and especially the color accents. I previously has a Cadillac ATS and before that a Caddy CTS. Obviously both of the Caddys road smoother. But frankly I got tired of the exorbitant repair and maintenance bills on cars that were only a few years old. Also there was so much technology on the Caddy's that it was constantly in the shop. One even a needed a new transmission when it was just 4 years old. So I was looking to downsize have a car with less electronics better mileage and just a simpler ride. The Juke is all of that and more! I can't say enough about how happy I am. I purchased it in June of 2016 and it really does get 30 mpg. And I have had no problems in the 10 months I've had it verses the probably 8 times the Cadillac was in for service during the first year. Often the service visits were recalls or simple technological glitches but frankly I don't think a new car should be in the shop at all in its first few years. And that's the case with my Juke. Yes the back seat is small but it is typically just me and my husband and my mom and I fit in the back just fine. Yes the trunk space is smaller than my previous car but the seats lie down easily so it's actually better then than before. Love love love it! Thank you Nissan Motor Corp for a solid sporty car that spends more time on the road and less time in the shop.,,,,

Nissan Motor Corp,2016,08/04/2016,Q3 2016,0,4," I test drove a couple of Jukes and really liked them.  However they seemed to have a lot of road noise.  This was the only reason I did not buy one.  I would also like for the ""pigtail"" on top to go away.  I think the ""pigtails"" on the top of vehicles looks dorky.",,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2009,02/07/2009,Q1 2009,0.8016,5, I researched this car for over a year against BMW M3 Mercedes C63 AMG Audi RS4 Corvette Z06 and I was coming from a WRX STi and I kid you not this car does it all. I had heard that it had a hard ride and was noisy but it is not the case. It handles beautifully and turns immediately when you want it to.The power is indescribable and the sound of the car in my opinion is just right (V8s are overrated). The interior is quality crafted and it has all the modern tech you could need or want. Do not buy if you need usable rear seats. It does better MPG than my STi did and the sound system is great. You had also better get used to the attention you will receive because they are so rare. The BEST,,,,

Nissan Motor Corp,2009,15-08-2008,Q3 2009,0,4, I have had my GTR for 4 months. There is an unnamed river road that is windy twisty and has dips. There are even a few straight lines. This road brings out the best in this vehicle. It will stick like glue easily handling anything I can dish out. Amazing! It is also my daily driver. Taking off slowly in first was initially unsettling but you get used to it. Excellent sound system.A car like this was a dream for me. I'm really a Porsche guy but the price of a late model turbo is out of my reach. But the GTR is the finest performance machine I've ever driven.,,,,

Nissan Motor Corp,2016,20-12-2015,Q4 2016,0.3612,4, I originally bought a 2015 SV V6 2WD King Cab (in May 2015).  After using it for 6 months it became obvious there was not enough room in the cab when I needed to carry passengers.  I was also a little disappointed with the lack of features I have become accustomed to in my new vehicles - heated  seats compass outside temp rear camera............,,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2016,04/05/2016,Q2 2016,-0.6258,5,While the reviews of this 2015 vehicle were not outstanding I was happy (overall) with my truck.  It was fairly noisy but it fit my expectations of a truck.  (I want to be able to carry stuff with reasonable expectations for performance and reliability.),,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2016,30-11-2015,Q4 2016,0.0621,5,So after getting a reluctant nod from my wife I bought the same truck as a 2016 (November 2015).  However this time it was a 4 door SV with the value truck package.,,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2016,08/05/2016,Q3 2016,0.0352,5,This version is much more usable with less road noise. Gas mileage is not outstanding but it's not rediculous (as you might expect from the reviews).  I get 20 mpg consistently (combined). The features and controls work well and are simple to use.  However they may be somewhat dated in their design.  Again they honestly meet my expectations for a truck.,,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2016,27-03-2016,Q1 2016,0.6747,5,I did look at the new Chevy when I bought the 2015.

Mileage from Las Vegas Valley to Waterton Lakes National Park Alberta Canada and back was 20.56 which included substantial 80 MPH speed limits.   Around town mileage is rated 15 MPG and that is what we get if only town (not typical).   Combined is about 17.5 MPG.   ,,,,

Nissan Motor Corp,2016,25-03-2016,Q1 2016,0.3818,5, Having owned many Rangers (which were very strong tough trucks) the Nissan Motor Corp Frontier is by far the better truck. Very strong frame very solid riding. The engine V-6  strong plenty of torque. The price advantage is excellent. A similar equipped Toyota Motor Corp Tacoma will list for apron $4.000 more.,,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2016,08/07/2016,Q3 2016,0.9612,5," Several packages over and above Std Crew Cab with 5 foot bed. Head restraints on back seats block 2/3rds of rearview mirror.  I removed the head restraints to have full view of rear of truck.  GPS/Navigation comes as a premium.  You can have GPS with custom mount for a lot less money and viewing the GPS is just off your right side of the steering wheel  at the 2 o'clock position.  I have used my TomTom 5/7"" on the last 4 Nissan Motor Corp Frontier Trucks with the same custom mount to the dashboard through the top vent of the left A/C vent.  The custom mount goes with me on each sale.  V6 Engine provides plenty of power when needed on the highway or on a city street.  I purchased separately a custom bed cover which enhances the gas mileage about 3% and completes the trim of the back of the truck.  Also keeps the storage area dry.  The bed extender attached to the inside of the bed with side & floor tracks with cleats has always been a must for the truck bed.  I am 6'4"" the Frontier offers plenty of leg room and head room.  So look over the various features and comfort packages to get what you need.",,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2016,25-05-2016,Q2 2016,0.1027,4, I bought this truck because I wanted a 4x4 midsize truck that would fit in my garage without paying 35+ thousand dollars. It is a nice reliable truck that is fairly comfortable in the front and I like the heated cloth seats. I drove 1000 miles straight thru and had no problems. However the back seats are terrible and I would feel sorry for anyone who has to ride in the back. Luckily I am generally the only one in it so for me it isn't a problem. The infotainment system is ok but not great. I have trouble with the primary apps (Pandora and Iheart Radio) dropping off occasionally and the speakers aren't great. It has dual climate control which I love. I also like the value package that came with the truck that allows for tying down cargo in the bed along with the bed extender. My biggest and loudest complaint is the awful terrible gas mileage. The truck has plenty of power which is nice but it is at the expense of gas mileage. There are full-size trucks out there that get way better fuel economy. In all it is a nice reliable truck. I like it and would recommend it but just understand what your getting. I am leasing this for another 1 1/2 yrs and will probably let it go primarily because of the gas mileage. However if they can improve on the fuel economy before my lease is up then I would have no problem getting another one because it is a nice truck otherwise.,,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2016,05/04/2016,Q2 2016,0.9784,5," Traded my 2009 dodge ram in for the 2016 Nissan Motor Corp frontier pro4x. I AM LOVE ! I have been looking for a new vehicle because my dodge literally was crumbling in front of me. Thought about going for the new Tacoma but I didn't like that it was the first run of the "" completely renewed Tacoma "" so I went for the frontier. The thought of it not being changed since 2004 really grabbed my attention as they hold their value so well. I owned a 2006 jeep wrangler before my dodge and I would say the frontier drives super similar to how the older jeeps drove which is why I fell in love with the pro4x. If you want a solid riding reliable truck then I say go for the frontier.",,,,
Nissan Motor Corp,2016,18-05-2016,Q2 2016,0.9713,5, So far I love this truck.  I have only had it a month and I love the way it drives and handles the road.  If I had to give a negative the navigation system is a little bit lacking and subpar to say a store bought dash GPS.Other than that Great Truck!!!,,,,

Toyota Motor Corp,1990,01/01/2016,Q1 1990,0.9382,5, Bought my 1990 4dr Corolla (base model no power anything) in 2014 for $865 as my first car. It wasn't in terrible condition but it had been sitting so all four tires were dry-rotted. I replaced the front two to avoid slipping in the winter serviced transmission performed an oil change and performed a tune up. With a couple hundred dollars into it it was running fine and continues to do so despite being 26 years old now. There is an exhaust leak the door handle fell off once and one night the battery terminal literally broke in half and disconnected itself while driving. Fixed it the next day with a $5 dollar one from Auto Zone and everything was back to normal. I've put ~10K miles on it in a little over a year. Being an 18-year-old boy it definitely isn't the most exciting thing to drive for me but it gets me where I need to go with around 30 MPG as I drive like a granny in town. Purely based on value it's a better one than any other first car I could've chosen. There was no other car I could've bought that would have cost this little and still work reliably every day.,,,,

Toyota Motor Corp,1991,31-03-2011,Q1 1991,0,4.375, I bought my 1991 Land Cruiser in Oct of 2009 with just over 120K on the odometer (a rare find indeed). Although not perfect the pros definitely outweigh the cons especially when you consider this is a 20 year-old used vehicle. Toyota Motor Corp quality is impeccable as expected; this truck will run forever if you treat it right and do all the correct maintenence. Things are going to break on a 20 year-old vehicle and it isn't going to be cheap but compared to anything else out there that's 20 years-old the problems are minimal. If you want a go-anywhere vehicle that can seat 7 and last a lifetime look no further than the Toyota Motor Corp Land Cruiser.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,1991,03/05/2014,Q1 1991,0.6943,5, This car is a wild beast. There is literally NOTHING the 4runner can't handle. My friends and I have taken her through streams rock climbing mudding and playing in the snow. I am so mean to this car yet it has never once failed me. It keeps going no matter what you throw at it. Lots of room reliable engine and it just looks so bad ass! I think it's important that you get the manual version though because automatics aren't as much fun and don't give as much control. If you want a car that will keep trooping past 250k miles this is the one for you. Take care of it and you will love it forever.,,,,

Although the initial investment to get it running right cost a lot I could not be happier. In the time since then I have added a new paint job all original new tires battery and went through the interior to replace missing parts. One modification I would tell everyone to do is switch it to partial 4WD this allows for 2WD during the the summer or non-bad weather/roads. I bought my kit for the front differential and hubs from Australia for about $500 and the labor brought everything to under $1000.00. This has saved me tons of money. It goes anywhere.,,,,

I have had to do only one head job on it but that was a dealership recall. I love it how this truck can go anywhere anytime. It has the perfect amount of cargo room mostly when you fold down the rear seats. This truck is perfect in an offroad environment too. I can definitely keep up with all the other guys in there souped up trucks in the sand. If your looking for a fun truck that lasts a life time and maybe even longer this should be your truck.  ,,,,

For a 16 year old car with 149K on it it's extremely reliable! The car averages 29-30 mpg in the city and 36-37 mpg on the highway. Only a few minor maintenance issues in the nearly six years I've owned it. Despite it's dated styling considering its performance I simply can't justify the expense of replacing it with a new car. Mine is a wagon and I wish Toyota Motor Corp would still offer new Corolla wagons in the US. Crossovers and SUV/s don't get the same mileage as plain old wagons.  If you're looking for a reliable used car definitely put the Corolla at the top of your list!,,,,

We just love it! It is extremely reliable in fact we have never been stranded in this car.  It takes whatever you do to it even inconsistency in maintenance. The body is rusting around the wheel wells but the car runs like the day we bought it.   We are looking to buy another Toyota Motor Corp since this car came out before air bags and we think we should have them for safety.  We bought this car when our daughter was in pre-school.

I've had to make two serious fixes - the clutch and exhaust manifold but that's just wear and tear. Keep the tires inflated and the oil changed and you can get 40 mpg in the city on this thing. Under the hood is simple the interior is comfortable - it's no lexus but it works. The air conditioner stays cold and the rear defrost works like new even after all these years.

Our old but new to us 1993 Land Cruiser proves why Toyota Motor Corp is the top automaker. We found our LC after driving new used and all possible choices between. After a friend told me the old LC's are great trucks and can go 200+K with no major failures we took a reluctant look at the beast. A week later we found a 1993 for sale by original owner wife driven 8000 miles or less per year all 100K maint already done. We bought the old LC and have been impressed ever since.

I am an ex 1999 Chevy Tahoe owner and while the Tahoe has more interior room and power it lacks the manners handling and off road capability that the older Toyota Motor Corp has.  I understand that this is the last year of the really heavy duty suspension.  So far I would buy this vehicle again and again.  ,,,,

Toyota Motor Corp,1996,17-03-2009,Q1 1996,0,4.125, I bought this car with almost 90000 miles I was a little nervous buying a used car with so many miles and for $15k.  I have now owned this car for 5 years and now have 140000miles there is a reason why these truck are legendary the are build strong and made to last.  This car is more comfortable than many newer cars and extremely reliable and excellent in the snow.  Other than some minor repairs and bad gas mileage the car will last forever.  I use this truck for everything from family trips to towing the boat to daily commuting like I said it is built to last.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,1996,04/04/2003,Q2 1996,0.3612,4.25, Bought the Land Cruiser because I heard of its great reliability.  Its been a good car able to haul kids up skiing and having no trouble with snow.  My problem is maintenance.  It goes through brake pads and rotors.  Second set of rotors in 80000 miles.  Also had the head gasket blow out in Vail which was extremely expensive.  Spent far more on maintenance on this car than any other I've owned including my Ford Motor Corps.  I leave it in the garage except to haul kids skiing.  Think I got the LC Lemon.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,1996,28-06-2005,Q2 1996,0.3612,4.375, I purchased this vehicle used in 1998 with 38000 miles. I bought my first Land Cruiser an FJ40 in 1976 and my first wagon in 1978.

It drives better than many new suvs coming right off the showroom. The only repairs in 15 years have been 1 radiator and 1 alternator. The power antenna just got tired of going up and down so now it just stays up. I had to re-upholster my two front leather seats a year ago due to normal wear and tear.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,1997,20-02-2003,Q1 1997,0.4019,4.625," How do I say ""I AM GLAD I DID"". I did my research and made my purchase.  If you enjoy getting into those hard to reach places where only few can travel;  This is definitely the vehicle for you.  Everything the write up's say are only speaking from the tip of the ice berg. I have traveled from my home in the highland deserts of SoCal to the even higher lands above Estes Park Colorado which was in the 11000 ft above sea level range. I presently live in North Western Louisiana. Believe me when I say that my Cruiser has been there.  It presently has just over 300000 miles on it and runs like new.

So far no mechanical/major problems but the AC stopped working. $900 to fix leak on condensor!! The reliability and the ""guts"" of the Cruiser are unmatchable. Snow rain no problem. Confident ride in such conditions. Fun to drive in nice fall weather. Windows roll all the way down. Huge sunroof. This vehicle will get you from point A to point B no doubt.

Toyota Motor Corp,1997,25-05-2016,Q2 1997,0.4939,5,The best part about this car is that every part no matter how big or small has been massively over manufactured. Every bolt  screw has been manufactured as if money was not an object. This truck does not need a road. Awesome feeling when you are off the road or in snow conditions. It even has a differential lock that allows maneuvering it out of rough terrains even though I have never used it knowing I have it makes me feel better. The transmission is something else. I have never had any transmission problems. ,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,1997,30-08-2005,Q3 1997,0.3182,4.5, I bought my LC new in 1997. It is the BEST car I have ever had. It now has 276000 miles and I have not had to hardly do any repair work other than oil changes (I do it every 3000 miles) brakes and tires. I was told this 6 cylinder engine should be trouble free for 500000 miles or more so my high mileage so far has not scared me. The only things that have given me trouble was the automatic car antenna and one of the little gadgets that extend out to electronically bend the front back seat. It does 15-16 mpg of regular fuel. The newer land cruisers with V8 do 14mpg with premium fuel. I recommend this car if you can get one with 100-150000 miles it's a better buy than a new car.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,1997,09/01/2010,Q3 1997,0.9783,4.375, Bought it around 2 years ago with 150k on it so far only had to change the rear 02 sensor and some normal wear items.   The only thing I don't like on this LC is the driver seat can't never find a comfortable position.  ,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,1997,08/08/2014,Q3 1997,0.6249,4.875, I bought this car with 94K and I am currently at 102k and my goal is to go half a million miles with this amazing car. I absolutely love this car. Its got this best engine ever made. Never ever gives up and will chug through just about any type of weather mother nature throws at it. Its 4x4 capabilities and high clearance makes me feel comfortable in any situation. I live in a thick mountain area and at -21 degrees it starts right up. This car is reliable and worth every penny! Plus it just looks amazing! Very unique compared to most other vehicles. This car will be around for my kids and grandkids.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,1997,28-10-2005,Q4 1997,0.0274,5,I cant think of any improvements. I recommend if you are going to buy an older Landcruiser 1997 is the year you want because all the kinks of prior years were taken care of. Make sure that all parts especially the engine and transmission are genuine. Once you get out of the original Landcruiser parts I doubt they would be as reliable,,,,

My only repair was a new radiator which I probably could have skipped but was on vacation with family and didn't want to chance it. Like previous reviewers the wife and I fought over this car although we had a newer one with less miles sitting in the driveway! I will definitely be buying another land cruiser. Although mileage is poor you make up for it with lack of repairs. Truly a pleasure to drive. Also like the previous reviewer we got rid of a Jeep Grand Cherokee to buy this.

NO scheduled maintenance ever just generic oil changes tires and brakes every so often. $4K later (a bargain!) it looks and rides just like new.  Best of all it has only 60K on the clock!  Even after 10 years of short trips and substandard preventative maintenance this LC still runs like new!

The Navigator Expedition and Sequoia. We were close to buying a newer Sequoia (2001) however we chose an older Land Cruiser (1998). The Luxury and ride of the Land Cruiser sold us.

Toyota Motor Corp,1998,01/03/2010,Q1 1998,0,4.625, Did the research in 2002 bought a 1998 TLC with 54000 miles on it from a dealer that picked it up off auction as a lease return.  This is one fantastic vehicle.  The whole is greater than the sum of the parts in this case.  The engine is not powerful by today's standards but quite adequate.  The cabin space is not enormous but very comfortable.  It will go anywhere out climb the Hummers leave the jeeps in the gullies etc. Handles snow and ice like a dream even on 13% grades in the mountains.  Locking differentials are a great option.

It does get only 16-17MPG tops but gas mileage is not why I purchased. It is the most reliable vehicle I have ever owned; it's solid it's safe. I just picked up today from having routine maintenance; my mechanic says there is nothing wrong with it! Change the timing belt every 60K change the oil every 4K do a tune up every 75K use Michelin's and they will drive forever. I have a friend with the same model with >300K and it still runs great! I have driven the Appalachians to the Tetons on road extreme off road and it has never let me down! Mine forever!,,,,

Toyota Motor Corp,2000,04/02/2005,Q2 2000,0,5, I just ordered my third new Land Cruiser (2007 model).  At 110250 miles my 2000 handled better drove tighter and was a smoother ride than every test drive we took of other comparable 2007 SUVs. The Land Cruiser has only needed two repairs (a starter and CD electrical problem) all these miles. It has reliably gotten me out of sticky situations numerous times ranging from snow packs in the Rockies to an approaching hurricane on the Florida Coast. The third seats are not as comfortable but are great for hauling my daughter's middle school basketball team.  The seats all easily tuck away in several formations for hauling everything from small trees to luggage. We couldn't go anywhere else.,,,,

Toyota Motor Corp,2000,30-07-2009,Q3 2000,0.6486,4, I bought this SUV in 2000 new.  I knew it was expensive compared to other SUV's but my 1996 Chevy Tahoe stranded my family and I for the third time in VT and I was willing to pay more for reliability.  Almost ten years later and this is by far the best vehicle I have ever owned.  105000 miles and it runs and rides like new.  Unlike my newer VW Passat and the Tahoe predecessor the TLC does not leak any engine oil or any other fluids on my garage floor to this day.  Only negatives are 16 mpg (no matter how you drive); very expensive parts when they fail; awkward third row seat arrangement; chews through tires at the front end (latest Michelins are holding up better than others). Best SUV!,,,,

Although I would imagine the reliability of the Toyota Motor Corp is better the need for premium fuel on top of dismal fuel economy is annoying.  Contrary to what another reviewer wrote there are very few places to put things on the console so sunglasses and stuff just hang around the shifters.  I am 6'3"" and there is insufficient leg room for a vehicle this size. Also the fold down rear seat does not disappear like in the Yukon blocking 1 1/2 feet of space - can't sleep in back  On the plus side the traction control is amazing and saved us from a half- way spin-out in the snow last year.",,,,

Over the last 9+ year our Highlander has never failed or given me any reason to curse the brand.  Outside of regular maintenance out highlander has stood the test of time.

My a/c went out withing 6 months had to pay $1200 to repair. Most recently my altenator went bad along with this other issue (can't remember) but combined that cost me $1200 and now I'm paying $1700 to have my 02 sensors (somethign i've read in reviews that go bad (denso brand)) valve cover gaskets AND fuel injector replaced.

They are shipped all over the world for tough off road conditions. Enjoy your Cruisers. I have owned 5 throughout the years. Do your research and you will not be disappointed.

Toyota Motor Corp,2005,22-06-2005,Q2 2005,0.0258,4.875, We bought our LC in the winter of 2005 and had Toyota Motor Corp not made the new ones look like overgrown Highlanders we would have bought a new one.  This is the single best vehicle I have ever owned.  I have driven it as a commuter on long road trips and even camped in it and it has exceeded expectations in every scenario.  I also love the interior appointments and the stateliness of the exterior styling and think of it as everything the Range Rover should be without the constant trips to the shop. With more than 5 years of ownership the only times it has been in the shop have been to repair body damaged caused by my wife's impatience and routine maintenance.,,,,

Toyota Motor Corp,2006,09/08/2008,Q3 2006,-0.8885,4, I purchased the long bodied 8-seater and although this car is no beauty to look at it is the best car I've ever owned and most certainly the best of my SUVs.  Because it is a diesel powered car the fuel consumption is much better than the gas models. It has great stability and efficiently corrects any tendency to sway in speedy curves.  Design is extremely sturdy and strong but heavy acceleration is remarkably good.  Service prices are quite reasonable.

Toyota Motor Corp,2007,21-04-2007,Q2 2007,0.7351,2.5, I did a lot of resaearch and was awed by the reliability ratings of this vehicle and the reputation.  I bought it based on these attributes but now I feel like I left a lot on the table in terms of style and features compaed to other similar vehicles.

Toyota Motor Corp,2010,26-09-2013,Q3 2010,0.9199,4.875, I really enjoy my 2010 Toyota Motor Corp Highlander Limited. This vehicle definitely has a great amount of power along with a smooth and quite ride. I have previously owned some of Lexus's high end SUV's and I must say I don't see much of a difference in the ride quality features style etc. Granted I did purchase the limited so the features are much improved over the base model. The only thing I can say negative about the highlander is fuel economy. I get around 16 mpg with a good mix of highway and city driving. I understand that is not awful for a midsize to somewhat larger SUV but I just don't like that,,,,

Highly impressive cockpit road visibility and totally quiet ride. My children love the DVD player an added bonus no doubt. Rear reclining seats are a must. The whole no-key thing takes some getting used to. It's like the VISA of SUV's. Toyota Motor Corp has offered a level of refinement related closely to a lux cousin.

Toyota Motor Corp,2012,02/09/2013,Q1 2012,0.4588,4.5,No regrets! This subcompact is not for racing. You want to race get something else.

The seats offer plenty of support and adjust in enough positions to allow me to drive comfortably.

Toyota Motor Corp,2012,07/02/2013,Q3 2012,-0.7096,5,In comparison to the Ford Motor Corp Fiesta and Focus the seats on the Prius C are heavenly! The ceiling of the interior cabin is comfortable for someone 6' tall. Beneath the armrest is a compartment but if you look at the bottom of it you'll see a notch to open up an even smaller compartment where you can stash something. The valet key is also nice because it prevents them from being able to open up the dashboard storage. Definitely read the manual cover to cover to get the best use out of all the little hidden features. Windshield wipers on the back window is also a huge plus. I don't bottom out over speed bumps and the tires are good on bumpy/potholed streets.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2012,13-07-2013,Q3 2012,0.9804,5,I wish there was an option for heated seats on all models and not just the Prius C model 4. I don't want all the fancy stuff on the 4 except the heated seats because it is cold in the mornings in Seattle 9 months out of the year. Maybe I missed it in the manual but having a simple default screen displaying the outside temperature and the direction (N W S E) you are driving would be nice. ,,,,

Toyota Motor Corp,2012,21-10-2012,Q4 2012,0,4.75, Between a Prius C and a MINI I ended up choosing the Prius mainly because of the fuel economy reliability and cost. My other commuter car is a 1990 Honda Motor Corp Civic DX also a small hatchbach and my second commuter car for the household. Surprisingly the Prius C engine is much louder when driving on the freeway in comparison to my 1990 Honda Motor Corp! You can tell the engine is working hard on the Prius to speed up but you can still pass cars easily on the freeway if needed. The interior is spacious and there is a nearly-hidden cup holder on the plastic compartment thing on the passenger door! I've never driven with a back-up cam and have no problems with the Prius C.,,,,

Toyota Motor Corp,2013,06/02/2013,Q2 2013,0.4215,4.75, I love my C! It is nimble well-made and fun to drive. Plus unlike so many other hybrids the mileage is no hype. I average 50 mpg and I've owned my car for about 4 months now. You go so long between fill ups that you almost forget about getting gas. Regarding the comments about acceleration it's no Ferrari but I've found it to be fine on on ramps and here in Philly that's no joke. Also many of the comparable hybrids sacrificed reliability. I don't think I should have to choose between great mileage and being stuck by the side of the road.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2013,14-04-2014,Q2 2013,0.836,4.875,  Update at 190000 miles.....4th set of tires installed last month. Replaced 12 volt battery as a maintenance thing. May change belts and hoses next month. Remarkably well running economical vehicle.,,,,

Toyota Motor Corp,2013,06/05/2015,Q2 2013,0.7389,4.375, I was a Prius sedan owner for 10+ years and was waiting for an AWD version (still waiting).  A few nonessential systems started to fail that would have been $1500+ to replace and there was this adorable little C on the lot with 19000 miles on it.  The interior feels a little plasticky compared to the full-size but it has a better sound system and a fun sporty ride.  I'd compare it to that of a Mini Cooper: low-riding road-hugging but getting an average of 49mpg with a fair amount of highway driving.  The price was great and I like the car more every day.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2013,04/09/2016,Q2 2013,0,4,"Better mileage readout and analysis. It's hard to work the screen readout and the radio it's unintuitive and clumsy.

Toyota Motor Corp,2013,24-04-2016,Q2 2013,0.2263,5, The Prius C is a small car but for a single driver who is commuting and occasionally carrying boxy items it can be a perfect fit. After 2-1/2 years I've had no major issues or mechanical problems with my car. It goes in for oil changes and once to have a remote release adjusted. That's the total maintenance and mechanical problems I've had. Others have said the car is noisy. If you floor it off a traffic light yes. In ordinary driving you can easily hold a normal voice level conversation with the people in the back seat.,,,,

Toyota Motor Corp,2013,16-07-2016,Q3 2013,0,4,I purchased it to be my commuter vehicle. I wanted something simple reliable and efficient. The PC is all of that.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2013,21-08-2016,Q3 2013,0.2263,5, I brought my 2013 Prius new in late December of 2013.  I've drove it for about 32 months and have about 47000 miles on it. The Prius C still runs great and I get well over 40 MPG and I don't drive 'slow'.  For me this is a Utilitarian vehicle and I am very satisfied. If you are trying to 'keep up with Joneses' you might want to look elsewhere. Sure it is kinda slow taking off but logic tells me to expect the Prius C to accelerate slow because I expect it to be efficient. I am big dude and there is plenty of room upfront for the driver and passenger when you slide the seats back.  It feels slightly bigger than my extended cab Ford Motor Corp Ranger.  I have even had 5 full size adults in the car. However with big people up front there is less room in the back because it is a small car.  The interior looks nice but I'm not a very materialist person. I've driven this car on many long trips: 5 hours 9 hours 8 hours each way. I've driven down a few bumpy dirt roads.  It rides fine from my prospective but I really don't care about the 'ride'. I'm a pretty 'tough' person; so the ride of a vehicle hardly impacts me. I've had plenty of used cars that ride terrible so in comparison this is great. So far no break downs but I'll report back at 80K miles. My only complaint is that in the snow the traction control makes it very difficult to drive.  I suggest buying a set of rims with snow tires if you live in an area that get lots of snow. If you are seeking a Utilitarian means of transpiration and do not need to transport more than 2-3 large adult; this is the car for you.,,,,

Toyota Motor Corp,2013,23-12-2015,Q4 2013,0.3612,5," Most people see the C as a downgraded Prius. I see it as the ultimate Econo-box. Even in the basic trim (One) this car has built in bluetooth turn signal indicators on the side mirrors mp3/usb a digital speedometer and that 4"" color screen chock full of information. Best part? 49-50mpg with A/C blasting in the summer and the heater blasting in the winter while driving it like a regular car (from stop & go to FWY speeds). Feels about the same as my previous car a manual transmission Yaris Hatchback with a way more modern / techy feel and design. Price-wise the cheapest C is comparable to the highest trims of the Yaris or Fit. Looking @ newspapers I've seen the One advertised for ~$17k.",,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2013,28-12-2015,Q4 2013,0.6888,5, People shy away from the Prius C because they like the bigger normal Prius better. But you save almost $10k on the C brand new! It really does get 48-50 mpg combined street/highway driving for us. It has great acceleration for such awesome gas mileage. The engine doesn't whine and scream like many cars in its class. This car is a joy to drive. It has the reliability you would expect from a Toyota Motor Corp (awesome!). And it holds more than we'd expect both in passengers and cargo. Our only disappointment so far is the low resale value after just a few years. We'll just keep it gladly.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2013,23-10-2016,Q4 2013,0.6124,5," I'm embarrassed that I love this little car this much! I'm an Environmental Science teacher and I hope I live an eco-conscious lifestyle but having a family has meant driving a larger car (a Camry) for years. I bought this to replace an ancient Corolla and handed the Camry down to the teenagers. Driving it is like playing a video game. Your high score is your mileage and you adjust your acceleration and steady speed to take advantage of the electric motor and accommodate traffic. As for the interior I have long legs and driver's side leg room is a little less than I'd like or I'd like the steering wheel to extend a little more than it does. I've put the teenagers in the back seat for short (30 min) rides and they are fine. The hatch is small but I wasn't looking for huge quantities of hauling storage and the rear seats do have a split fold-down. I found it in ""habanero"" which is really orange and I love having the most cheerful car in the parking lot :-) And consistently getting over 50 mpg is so much fun! Once I got up to 76.1 mpg!",,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2013,11/01/2016,Q4 2013,0.9561,5, If you are looking for a super-cool one of a kind yuppie worship vehicle don't buy this. If you are looking for super dependable safe reliable economical transportation buy this. My purchase was made strictly because my new business required these features not extra cup holders and lots of chrome features. In the two and a half years of ownership I have driven 160000 miles and the car still runs like new. Maintenance has been synthetic oil/filter change every 5000 miles. Transmission fluid changed at 50000 miles tires every 55000 miles. Tuneup at 100000 miles and brakes rotor replacement at 135000 miles. I was forced to drive over a wooden pallet at 70 mph on the interstate because I couldn't change lanes . Bent front steering arms and in a couple of hours back on the road. Didn't even have a flat tire but could have used fresh underwear.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2013,28-11-2016,Q4 2013,0.9762,5, The car is just perfect as a 3rd car.  I have an A5 and a Volvo S60 Cross Country and the Prius C 4 is still a hoot and a blast to drive.  I call it my little truck with hatch and use it for home depot Walmart Target etc for big shopping I can review stock market my wife shops with the entune system we check the weather listen to satellite radio cruise set at 70 on parkway with Climate control on and heated seats whilst never taking hands off wheel. and our navigation system is finding the way while we enjoy the scenery.  I can only recommend the 4 level the 15 inch wheels and the optional interior weather tech floor mats.  I also recommend the hatch floor mat tinting the windows and rear bumper guard.  I drive the car from NY to Pittsburgh all the time and gas costs me about 26.00 dollars each way incredible.  Never had an issue with the car did replace the brakes and tires within 27K and wipers but I average 48.7 MPH for the life of Car.  Mileage goes down 8 MPG in winter with winter fuel.  Plus people love it some call it clown car but cant believe how roomy the interior is and the technology it has.  My favorite feature is MPG Heated Seats Entune System Touch Screen Graphics Steering wheel controls cargo capacity and bullet proof reliability.  My least favorite feature is the Faux Leather and the headlight system is not bright enough which I have upgraded especially for winter weather driving in pittsburgh.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2014,26-02-2015,Q1 2014,0,3.25,As for the car itself I find the seats to be very comfortable the build materials are fine after all it is an inexpensive car.  The 3 level has some cool features like push button start doors unlock when they detect the key and touch screen with navigation.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2014,19-05-2016,Q2 2014,0.7906,4, They should have talked to me first.  This was a rushed purchase and I very well might still have bought it.  I had been a devoted Nissan Motor Corp Sentra owner since the Datsun B-210.  Kept them all over 10 years.  But then you get to that point where needed repair expenses could be invested in a new car...in this last case I had a broken spring a surprise so it wasn't safe to drive.  The pressure was on.  The new Sentra was way too big for my comfort and fitting in the garage with a Chevy...and I hated the console between the two front seats.  My sister had the Prius C...so I wound up at a Toyota Motor Corp  dealership I should have walked away from.  It was a terrible lesson learned the hard way...But back to the car....It was a good fit with a comfortable seat...and it was...okay...cute.  ANd there were colors beyond silver and black...The finish of the dash does look like one review noted as if there are scratches...which I guess is good because when my protective pup jumped up or a clip board slid down both leaving marks...it's less obvious.  Never happened in the Sentra...so I think they could do better about that.  The little pen section on the dash is a pain...it holds dust and crumbs and is a pain to clean.  I like closed concealed space.  The cupholders are in a great position...up front and center on below the dash...but they were not smart enough to make a liner that could be removed to be washed.  I also dislike the placement of the other driving mode buttons beneath the handbrake.  If my pup is with me she can easily stand on that.  I was able to get a strong small container that was shallow enough to place over the buttons and then put a folded towel over that.  Problem solved...  It also was a big transition to go from a trunk to a condensed space in back.  In thinking about getting a new piece of luggage I had to measure carefully to make sure it would fit to be concealed.  So I guess it's true that it is more a city car and not one for a road trip with more adults who have baggage unless it's short trips with limited bags.    I also woke up in a sweat after starting the sales process when I realized that my pup who can be protective and even if not...could squeeze her way through over the back seat and out the hatch if she were determined.  A real scare factor for me.  As a precaution I both have her secured via seat belt loop and also got one of those metal barriers which I put behind the back seat.  And of course...you've gotta love the gas mileage.  That is a relief.  Going totally electric would just be too nerve wracking for a single woman driving alone...,,,,

Toyota Motor Corp,2015,10/08/2015,Q4 2015,0.9585,5, I got my silver Prius c One about 3 months ago and I am absolutely loving this car!!! Since most of my driving is in the city I'm averaging a ridiculous 57 MPG without doing anything special. I also love the look and feel of the interior - feels very premium for an entry-level car. The light gray seats (only available on the One) are super soft and comfortable (so much better than all non-leather seats on other cars). The color combination of the seats and dashboard/head unit looks amazing with the silver exterior color. There is also a surprising amount of space inside - way more than you would think looking at the car's exterior. I'm also very pleased that Toyota Motor Corp added a touch screen softer interior materials and LED headlights & taillights all standard for the 2015 model - they really give the car a premium feel. Combine this with an incredible price of $18500 ON THE ROAD free 2 year maintenance rock-solid Prius reliability with a tried-and-true hybrid system - and you have a car that's very hard to beat. The only reason I wouldn't recommend this car is if you do ALL of your driving on the highway - you'd be better off with a Corolla or Mazda3 for the same price. But even if you do mixed city/highway this car is still fine - I have no problem getting this car up to 80-85 MPH (slightly more road/wind noise than Corolla/Mazda3). And if you do mostly city like me the Prius c is the halo car for congested stop-and-go traffic areas like mine - not only for fuel efficiency but more importantly for pollution (which can be 10 times less compared to other cars in these conditions). The bottom line: I could not have wanted a better car than my 2015 silver Prius c One :),,,,

Toyota Motor Corp,2015,25-10-2015,Q4 2015,0.995,5, I have previously driven Honda Motor Corp Fits (07 and 2012) but I didn't care for the new redesign. I never really considered the Prius (was leaning more towards a Crz or Golf) but that was before I saw the c at a dealership one night. It was shining in the moonlight and looked so edgy- futuristic. I test drove it the next day and it was mine within the week! I REALLY ENJOY my c. It hugs the road through messy weather and brakes nicely. The interior is very stylish-blue instrumentation and a touchscreen light the front. The c is so quiet. One foggy night we left the movies and before we hit highway speeds it felt surreal - silently cutting through the fog the futuristic interior/blue glow and high powered LED lights- so memorable. The fuel economy is excellent! The acceleration takes some time getting used to but now I know how it handles- its not peppy like a Fit but it isn't a sluggard either. Because it is a Hybrid it is not a powerhouse but I never feel intimidated merging or traveling on the interstate as the engine does have a little kick when needed! The c holds quite a bit too-flatten the rear seats in any combo and it almost gives the Fit a run for its money in storage space. I do wish it had more hidey-holes and cup holders like the Fit though. I truly feel blessed to have and drive such an amazing little car. Respect the Prius!,,,,

Toyota Motor Corp,2015,11/10/2015,Q4 2015,-0.3629,5, I leased a 2012 Prius C Two and when the lease was up debated buying it but given it was November I negotiated a deal on a 2015. The three years with the 2012 were trouble free but the 2015 upgrades are noticeable. The most practical improvement is the headlights which now project a good distance ahead. Aesthetic improvements include new vents a vastly improved climate control interface and updated taillights. The Three includes Toyota Motor Corp's E-tune system which is a mixed bag. The voice recognition can be quite frustrating and the navigation has little going for it verses Google maps on my phone. The Bluetooth interface however is seamless and using apps like Pandora is great on long trips. Consistent across the years is the excellent fuel economy and trouble free motoring.,,,,

Toyota Motor Corp,2015,29-11-2015,Q4 2015,0.9853,4," Upgraded interior from the year before definitely was a plus. Navigation and push start is standard at Three trim and above. LED headlights and tail lights are standard on all Prius C's. The car has a smaller engine than the regular liftback but at the same time more efficient on gas. Easy to park being about 155"" long. We did a lot of research on compact cars before settling on this one a close second was the Versa Note and the third car the Honda Motor Corp Fit.",,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2015,12/05/2015,Q4 2015,0.9044,5, While for some the Prius v with reclining rear seats is a must and still others inclined to jump into the Prius liftback (the Prius that started it all) I have to emphasize the amazing parkability of the Prius c!  I was given a Prius c for a day by the dealership and at the time decided the car was too small for the long term.  A month later my roomate got the Prius c and for the last two years I've had the pleasure of test driving it on weekends.  Living in Los Angeles it is extremely satisfying to be able to fit into parking spaces that you wouldn't even attempt with other cars relative to the size of the worlds best selling car also built by Toyota Motor Corp.  That one space that is truly just big enough for a compact car that is between a cement pillar on one side and a large truck parked at an angle over the dividing line on the other side the only space available in the lot because nobody else could fit in one so small and compromised.. Pull in with pride in your Prius c!  Sometimes this is the difference between making your appointment on time and circling up or down level after level in a parking structure.  The interior is spacious and comfortable and it drives with a wonderful center of gravity giving it the feel of a much heavier car.  There's also the fact that the Prius c is the highest mileage non plug-in hybrid car available.  I've averaged as high as 92.4 miles per gallon going from point A to point B 'from trip start.'  Otherwise nothing short of 50 MPG driving normally and even with a heavy pedal to merge onto the freeway.  It has a surprising amount of pep for it's size an if you step down hard on the pedal the car definitely holds its own.  I've wanted a Prius for a long time am the last one in my circle of friends and family to get one and am happier with the car than I imagined I would be.  Passing fuel stations for weeks at a time and filling a nine gallon tank when I visit one is more exciting to me now than the sound of a racing car engine used to be.  If you don't know the awesome definition of SULEV may I suggest you look it up or better yet call a Toyota Motor Corp store and ask.  It is the best reason to get this car!  If I could change one thing about the car it would be built in America like many other Toyota Motor Corp vehicles.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2015,28-12-2015,Q4 2015,-0.802,5, Gettin older and I needed a car with value and the least maintenance short of an EV while maintaining my 2 teen's NON hybrid older vehicles.  This is it. Bought it because of the best CVT in the business and the expected reliability.  I've not been disappointed. After 3 years the only thing I have done is changed the oil at 10K intervals the cvt fluid and plugs at 100K. Shocks and struts are next. The plugs were still in good shape but recommend dealer because it is not easy for most people. I know we will get 300K and beyond out of this vehicle on the original batteries alone. Mileage has only slipped 1 mpg in 3 years which is normal for any vehicle with this mileage already.   My new Altima has already had problems and been in the shop twice for premature rust.  Yup new car.  Will likely never buy another Nissan Motor Corp as their CVT still has issues.   Can't wait to get the larger prius hatchback after the kids leave the nest.  There is a reason these cars are preferred by Taxi companies.  Less maintenance best value currently.  These cars are the best bridge until EV's can go 200+ miles per charge and are cost competitive.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2016,01/05/2016,Q1 2016,0.5707,5,Engine:  (in my opinion) - this is a truck with a large but factory choked V6.  Toyota Motor Corp probably keeps it detuned for long lasting and reliable reasons!  I'm certain this rig is easily capable of 325+ HP if tuned.   ,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2016,03/04/2016,Q1 2016,-0.3626,5,- The driver seat needs some lower lumbar support at least for my back. My Jeep has an adjustment on the seat that does that; this car does not.  ,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2016,03/11/2016,Q1 2016,0.7579,5, When I bought my 2009 Prius I was very pleased with the car and the gas mileage.  However I was disappointed I had to give up certain creature features that I had in my 2005 Prius.   However my 2016 Prius exceeds my expectations as compared to my 2005 Camry.  I have the moonroof I gave up with my 2009 Prius.  However I now have all of the features I use to have with my Camry.  All of the electronic safety are fantastic.  It has an excellent ride and is very quiet on the road.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2016,27-03-2016,Q1 2016,0.6249,3, The slightest crosswind or crown in the road sends the car left and right. It could be in part due to the heavy battery ballast under the seats. Or maybe it was just designed wrong. ,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2016,01/06/2017,Q1 2016,-0.5106,5, I got this to be a commuter car.  It's perfect for that in my opinion.  The gas mileage is through the roof.  After 25000 miles I average 52 mpg overall and higher under certain circumstances.  It's not the quietest car but it's a lot quieter than my minivan.  It's comfortable.  The controls are easy and logical.  The built-in USB support is really nice.  Cargo space is tight if you have the back seats up but great if you fold them down.  I really really enjoy just tooling along in this car.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2016,01/11/2017,Q1 2016,0.9858,5, The Prius C is built to save gas.  Acceleration is slow even if you try and and gun it.  It is adequate enough to speed up more than the average car in normal driving.  In freeway entrance with two lanes I'm more than 90% faster than other cars I assume driving normally and not racing me.  The battery charging without the plug in but by the combustion engine is adequate to lower MPG by assisting in acceleration and taking over the stop and go without turning the gas engine on.  I've heard people complaining about the braking system.  It doesn't take long to get used to it and enjoy the regenerative braking and see the animation of your batteries being charged.  If you are childlike in terms of personality you'll probably hate and throw a tantrum so don't buy it.  For the thinking person it's quite a joy to see how efficient the Prius C is.  I see it more appealing to people who eat healthy and understand the importance of quality living and not the junk food crowd who are more into satisfying their hunger and feelings.  The CVT continuous variable transmission is awesome. It's actually more efficient and quicker than the regular planetary automatic or manual transmission.  The CVT does not have a pause power is constantly applied making it quicker.  I heard that CVT was rejected by dumb consumers on regular cars because they wanted the feel of the inefficient of gear shifting.  CVT was acutally conceptualized by Leonardo DaVinci in 1490 and was first patented in 1829 for a saw mill.  First cat to patent is Daimler Benz in 1886.  I got the Prius C one the most basic for me the car is not for luxury or sport use it's a way to save money.  I got 2 Mercedes a Ram Hemi a BMW Z4 and Mini Cooper S for the fun sport and luxury part of driving.  For my cheap side my family drives the technologically advance and energy efficient Prius C.  You can't help but love it.,,,,

Toyota Motor Corp,2016,13-02-2017,Q1 2016,0.9348,5, I live in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania more so east of Pittsburgh I originally had a 2002 Toyota Motor Corp camry with a V6 engine. It had 200k on it and it was 15 years old the transmission was starting to slip and I decided that it was time for an SUV as my camry got me through college and grad school for me. I wanted an SUV that was on a Frame.  Everything is gearing towards cross over and AWD which I did not want.  Ive been searching for over a year trying to find a used 4runner that would be a great deal.  Everything that I saw wasn't worth it buying used.  These do not depreciate they hold there value hence why I decided to purchase a new one instead of a used one.  I have always wanted a 4runner and I found the trail premium has a lot more features to go off roading which I felt like this was the best value if I ever decide to sell it would hold is value more than the lower model 4runners.  I got white because it holds its value better and it is easier to keep clean.,,,,

Toyota Motor Corp,2016,03/07/2017,Q1 2016,0.6369,4," My husband and I are both 70.  We are conservative very conservative and the idea of buying a high-mpg car usually drives our car searching.  We were pretty sure we were going to go with a Prius and we narrowed it down to a Prius C Four or a Prius Three Touring.  We wanted the amenities of leather seats and a navigation system.   We were tired of allowing time to get lost every time we were going to a new location.  We drove a Prius C Four first - it was bright yellow which was probably not age-appropriate but we liked it except for one thing . . . the way the engine groaned when you needed it to climb a hill.  We loved the car more than we had expected.  Then we drove the Prius Three Touring and there wasn't anything about it we didn't like.  The price difference between the two cars was about $4000.  We were trying to drag out the shopping timeframe to guard against an impulse buying.  Our sales person told us about his Prius Four Touring that he had just traded in the day before.  It wasn't ready to test drive but we looked at it and noticed it had the blind spot detectors.  It was 3 months old and had less than 4000 miles on it.  So the idea of that car was just hanging out on the ""back burner"" for a week or so.  Another dealer let us take either of the cars we were interested in over the weekend.  So we took a Prius C Three (they didn't have a four at that dealership) for the weekend.  So on Saturday we took the borrowed Prius C on an outting that took us to the dealership with the Yellow C Four and the Used Prius Four Touring.  We drove that yellow car again and still liked it.  Then asked to drive the used Prius Four Touring.  Our original salesman was off that day and they were busy so they let us drive the Four Touring without a salesperson in the car.  We hardly drove off the lot before we looked at each other with eyes of super approval.  When we got back to the dealership the substitute salesperson was nowhere to be found.  We waited about 20 minutes and then just left and took the borrowed Prius C back to the other dealership.  I emailed the original salesperson and told him we wanted his Four Touring.  And two days later we took it home.  It still growls a little going up hills from a cold start but not as much as the C did.  In the end it was the extra safety features that sold us on the car . . . afterall we're not as mentally sharp as we once were.  :-(",,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2016,18-04-2016,Q2 2016,0.1793,5, I ended up with a Prius due to a strong strong recommendation from a family member who swears by them.  I took a data-driven approach to justifying the purchase showing that the Prius is the car the minimizes lifetime cost for a set of safety reliability and size characteristics.  Here the Prius has lived up to my expectations.  So yes the Prius does often make sense for your brain.  However make sure that it's really the car that you actually want too.  A bunch of things beyond the numbers really bug me about it.  The outside is really ungainly and the inside's high contrast color scheme isn't my style.  The center speedometer I thought would be fine but when I hold my hand around 2 o'clock on the steering wheel my hand blocks it.  Without a doubt the Prius is an incredibly well engineered car but that's not all there is to a car purchase.  If I were doing it again I'd choose one of the many other cars that is also well engineered but looks and feels a bit more conventional.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2016,25-04-2016,Q2 2016,0.5195,4,Transmission:  The 5 speed is dated (albeit reliable as it approaches the end of the development cycle).   ,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2016,05/12/2016,Q2 2016,0.0442,5, This car takes my breath away.  It is a luxury car that gets fantastic miles per gallon.   I couldn't ask for anything better.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2016,13-05-2016,Q2 2016,0.7405,4, I bought this car as a secondary commuting car to save massive amounts of gas money as I drive probably 70-80 miles a day during the week. I figured it would just be a means to get me from point A to B with four wheels a steering wheel and great gas mileage.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2016,18-05-2016,Q2 2016,-0.25,4,To me it's a truck with extra seating and storage.  The 4x4 including crawl locker and terrain select have been used quite extensively by this driver.  I've been in back country fresh snow (a few times now) mud and desert.   The factory Dunlop GrandTrek tires remain as the Achilles heel when playing in fresh deep snow or mud.  So far (knock-on-wood) the 4Runner has taken everything I've thrown at it.   Of course keep in mind being alone miles from nowhere I've had to keep a conservative approach to things! ,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2016,18-06-2016,Q2 2016,0.9564,4, Never had a 4WD vehicle before but took my new ride to the nearby mountains to try it out. Got worried real quick on a few trails that put me at bad angles but the SUV handled them real well and improved my confidence fast. Worries of low gas mileage EPA rates at 18 already higher if I limit the 4WD. Last fill I got over 20mpg but my last car was a Prius which averaged nearly 50. I'm doing okay and expect to get better mileage as I go along. Have been driving Toyota Motor Corps for 30 years and never had a bad one. At my first fill-up the guy behind me came up and said I'll enjoy the 4Runner he has over 300k miles on his with only two minor problems. I expect the same from mine.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2016,07/07/2016,Q3 2016,0,5, This 4th gen Prius is not the same car as older versions.  In the one month that I have had the car I continue to be surprised by the many preconceptions that have been proven wrong.  1) It accelerates well - step on the gas and the electric motor together with gas engine will pick up the speed very nicely.  I have not had to floor the accelerator yet when passing or merging onto freeway.  2) EPA gas mileage of 53 is wrong.  It is also wrong that highway MPG is lower than local.  I have been averging 63 combined and little difference between local and highway.  3) It handles very well thanks to the new 2016 rear suspension.  Coming from a BMW 3 series the handling is comparable around corners and turns.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2016,08/10/2016,Q3 2016,0.8074,4,I was pleasantly surprised even on the test drive but even more so after driving it daily for the past 5000 miles.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2016,09/07/2016,Q3 2016,0.0772,5, Absolutely love my new 4Runner. It is off the charts in terms of reliability durability and pure function; this truck can go anywhere and do anything. Don't let reviews about poor handling sway you - this handles accelerates and drives fantastic for the type of vehicle this is: a body on frame truck. For anyone looking for superb reliability great style and a vehicle that can go anywhere under any circumstance for 15+ years this is for you.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2016,13-09-2016,Q3 2016,0.3612,5,Let me start off with my complaints although they are somewhat trivial: ,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2016,13-11-2015,Q4 2016,0.1511,5,Reason for purchase:  4x4 alone quite often and needed a reliable vehicle to get me into the middle of nowhere.  As an amateur astronomer I also needed room for dry/clean storage.  Also needed an interior long enough for sleep (I don't tent). ,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2016,24-12-2015,Q4 2016,0.9734,5, Simple review: Buy one if you want to off-road more than the average bear!    ,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2016,10/03/2016,Q4 2016,0.9061,3,Some minor disappointments.  Less internal storage in the car.  Lost the above glove compartment storage and storage area under the center console.   Also lost the limited storage area located over the spare tire.  Oh ya I got a model 4.  The problem is I no longer have a temp spare tire but a repair kit and inflator.  The is a [non-permissible content removed] moment when I realized that I paid more for a model 4 and didn't get a spare tire.  My salesman is trying to get me information on why.  We looked at a model 3 and it had the temp spare tire.   This may have been an engineer decision where because of the additional safety features in my model 4 they had to balance the overall weight of the vehicle by eliminating the temp spare tire.  Come on Toyota Motor Corp that is not right.   Positive on a recent 30 mile round trip I averaged 60 MPG with normal driving condition.  Love that!,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2016,10/06/2016,Q4 2016,0.7126,5, 2016 Limited 4500 miles - my wife's truck...love everything except for a transmission noise. It is common to other 4runners as the dealer took us for a ride in a new limited with 0 miles and it also had the noise. It is a sort of tinny rattling sound coming from the transmission and for a tight truck like this you would not expect it. If not for that it would be great sort of surprised Toyota Motor Corp allows this. If it gets worse we will address it if not I expect we will live with the annoyance of the sound.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2016,11/03/2016,Q4 2016,0.128,4,- The forward view from the driver seat is great; however there are enormous blind spots on the side and the rear windshield is tiny. Makes changing lanes in Chicago traffic interesting to say the least.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2016,19-11-2016,Q4 2016,-0.4767,1,"I've verified the alignment twice and even scheduled a test drive with the service manager. He told me he didn't think there was anything wrong. Serves me right for thinking I was accompanied by an ""expert""! My 94 Corolla wagon with the bent tie-rod steers much better than this vehicle.",,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2016,12/12/2016,Q4 2016,-0.1154,5, Love It.  Second one now.  1st one was great as is this one so far.  Just wish they would offer a no carpet rubber mat option or at least easily removable carpets for those of us who use it as a SUV rather the soccer mom driving their kids to town and never getting off pavement.  Get a Highlander or mini van!  Owned various American corporations SUV's and trucks until got tired of sitting in the garage waiting on them to fix whatever broke next still under warranty!  I used the term Am. Corps rather than American SUV's as many are made out of this country and those assembled in the country often have mostly foreign parts so....The issues were often recurring ones and warranties end so guess who pays then.  Repairs seemed to start @ $500 and go way up from there!  Haven't had one issue since making the switch to Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Corp 15 vehicles back.  Not one other than the gas pedal recall when someone was looking to make a fast buck due to their ignorance!  5 minute fix done at normal service appointment.  My wife and I EACH drive around 35000-40000 a year mostly for work so we don't have time to be sitting at the dealership waiting for them to patch issues resulting from shoddy design failures and/or poor workmanship.  Come trade in time the Toyota Motor Corp's and Honda Motor Corp's have consistently cost us $4000 to $6000 less in depreciation!  They hold their value if taken care of!  I imagine that is a result of the dependability vs. the American crap we used to drive.  My only complaint with the Toyota Motor Corp's and Honda Motor Corp's I have owned is that the tires that come with the base vehicles are junk.  Now I make them take the tires off immediately and put on Michelin's.  Secondly is the paint.  Total junk.  Scratches with weeds and even fingernails at the door handle!  GM Motor Corp used Dupont paints and clear coats and there is a world of difference.   I would rate the 4 Runners Highlanders and Pilots 10/10 if it weren't for those two glaring deficiencies.  While not perfect they are the best out there we and 12 of our family members have found.    While this one is relatively new my wife and I have driven slightly over 1 Million miles in Honda Motor Corp's and Toyota Motor Corps.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,01/03/2017,Q1 2017,0.9833,5, The Corolla iM was compared to the Honda Motor Corp Civic LX and Mazda3 Sport.  It won the financial terms and was second for technical/performance. I valued safety (with front collision avoidance more important than the excellent Mazda Blind Spot Monitoring) controls and instrumentation (yes you can see the display in bright sunshine) and acceleration.  The Corolla iM was third in the last category but it's okay.  I really enjoyed my Mazda 3 with the 2.5L 184 hp but this vehicle would cost another $ 2 or $3 G.  Toyota Motor Corp only needs to drop a higher powered engine (such as the Scion tC that I had for seven years) and add blind spot monitoring.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,01/08/2017,Q1 2017,0.9488,5," Great interior layout.  Wonderful screen suite with lots of options on info to display.  Really like the 11"" screen with ability to have map on top half and something else on bottom with music title and artist along very bottom.  Speedometer in middle of dash works well and helps inside of vehicle seem even more roomy.  Driver cockpit is spacious and well designed (I'm a 6'2"" man with a few extra pounds on my frame).  Gas savings work like a charm.  Babying it I'm able to get a combined 58 mpg (based on real miles divided by gas put into tank and not just the trip computer which can suffer from 1/x issues for small x for even average trips ~40 miles where x is the gas consumed).  That 58 mpg was without plugging in to charge for full EV mode.  Plugging in is simple and running in full EV mode the car runs like a champ.  Just don't expect Camaro performance but who would ever think that way about a Prius Prime anyways? Overall range > on a single tank is wonderful especially since my work commute is 90 miles round trip -- I'm back to being able to fill up once a week instead of every fourth day.  Bought in Dec 2016.",,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,01/11/2017,Q1 2017,0.9884,3, Nice driving car.  Lower gears excellent fro stop and go traffic.  Can hang in second gear.  Very broad torque curve.  Can accelerate to freeway speeds in 3rd gear.  Top gear acceleration in 6th is impressive.  The engine turns 3000 rpm @ 75.  Very easy to hit triple digits.  Very quiet and composed on the freeway.  Suspension soaks up dips very stable - no wandering over uneven roadway.  Seats are comfy and the auto temp control is a real plus.  Surprising room in the boot.  I donated my old minivan but saved a large box fo storing things.  Fits in the back of the IM with space to spare.  People in the back seat like the center armrest.  This car is a great value we love to take on trips.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,01/12/2017,Q1 2017,0.9598,5, If you are into a green car this is almost a no brainer. With the tax deduction it is very competitive to the regular Prius but you get an EV vehicle of about 25 miles. The car drives much better then my 3nd generation hybrid which I really loved. It's a lot quieter. I like the futuristic styling realizing it's not for everybody. By the way electric really only make economical sense if you have a solar system. It sucks but gas is otherwise very competitive,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,19-01-2017,Q1 2017,-0.1007,5,"My recommendation:  Buy this safe well-crafted car.  Then disable the pre-collision system and lane departure alert ""safety features"" before driving it off the dealership parking lot.",,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,20-01-2017,Q1 2017,0.997,5, I traded a 9 year old matrix on new IM cvt .If the IM is as reliable as the XR was then Ill be a happy camper. I did have to give up cargo capacity and towing capabilities so time will tell how much that'll be missed but made a huge gain in handling  comfortand fuel economy. Added bonus...auto insurance lower due to all the advanced safety features. Overall I am very satisfied with the value and contrary to some reviews I find the engine and transmission performance quiet and responsivereturning mpg's in the high 30's low 40's. Only complaint is the projector beam headlamps..very sharp cutoff and not a wide enough path.Will probably solve with driving/fog lamps at some point.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,02/01/2017,Q1 2017,0.8357,5,What I don't like was hardly a deal breaker - it doesn't come with Sirius but I just attached the kit and use the auxiliary port.  No CD but that is more common now in new cars as you can use a USB stick.  There is also some useless entertainment app installed but I use what I want and the sound quality is great for this sporty cute car.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,13-02-2017,Q1 2017,0.9787,5, So far my favorite generation. The seats are very comfortable. It achieves what you want it to do. Which is great gas mileage. I do recommend a 240 V charger. I got one  for less than $300 installed it myself and takes less than two hours to get a full charge of 22+ miles of electrical mode.   The lane departure assist is fairly weak. I wish it was more assisting in putting the car back in the middle of the road. You do you have to wash your car a lot to keep the sensors clean so they operate properly.   I do enjoy the adaptive cruise control. I drive a lot about 30000 miles a year. I also love the heated steering wheel even more than the heated seats.   I like the styling of the car. And the headlights are amazing at lighting up the road and giving you optimal visibility rain or shine.    The menu is a little bit confusing at first but you'll get the hang of it. It does give you lots of options on how to customize your settings etc. the big downside is the Chi charger it only works on Samsung phones. Not iPhones. I used to own a 2010 Prius. But This car is far more better looking.  The JBL stereo is just so so. Nothing fancy I thought it would be better. It does the job but I wouldn't mind a better upgrade.   I average 55 to 60 miles a gallon using hybrid mode. And I get 22 to 25 miles on electrical after I plug it in. One downside is driving fast. For example cruising at 75 mph or more I'll get about 47 miles per gallon.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,21-02-2017,Q1 2017,0.9412,4," Overall the Corolla iM is a great little car; once the pre-collision system and other misguided ""safety improvements"" are disabled.  The car alarms every time it rains.  Literally.  The car alarms then *cuts power to the engine* while merging on the freeway!  This inherently safe car has been made unsafe to drive because control of the vehicle is taken away from the driver at the worst possible times.",,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,03/01/2017,Q1 2017,0.9788,5, Bought in Rhode Island I drove it 1200 miles home; 21 hours sitting comfortable and listening to iPhone tunes; 55.7 MPG; one fuel stop at 600 miles; dynamic cruise control followed high-balling trucks and; the radar looking through the rain and fog of the Poconos at I-81 speeds. It automatically paired with my iPhone 5s. Once home the second tank ran 699 miles at 60 MPG. The second week 7 days and 301 miles EV with 2/3ds using 'free' chargers around town ~$2.50 out of pocket. In EV it scoots around traffic without a problem using MG1 and MG2 as if they were a single motor. At a light off the line it instantly silently shames the noise machines. Taken fast the suspension flattens 'speed bumps'. Great visibility it no longer feels like being in a foxhole and finally the outside review mirrors cover the lanes on both sides. It is the first Prius strangers have volunteered that 'it looks good.' Unlike the driving folklore around our Gen-1 and Gen-3 Prius the Prius Prime does everything without tricks. For example engine warm-up the bane of all Prius the Prime handles by running in EV while the engine gently warms up. Then a couple of minutes later the warmed engine is giving over 60 MPG in the city.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,03/10/2017,Q1 2017,0.962,2, I was excited to check out the Corolla I'm but immediately put off by the garish slash of misplaced design across the dash and the fact that there was no CD player. Some of us still like cd's and don't really want to be put into a position to have to buy some over priced  iphone just to enjoy a little music. Anyway what about books on cd for those long trips.  Not everyone wants to conform to your idea of the latest trend no need to fix what isn't broken.  See ya I'm off to by something else.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,03/12/2017,Q1 2017,0.568,3, I'm only 5ft 6 inches in height but I had to contort my head and neck entering and exiting my Scion IM.  Power was nothing great either. Moned and strained on hills.  Dashboard controls  were boring.  I kept the car only a year and a half then traded it for a 2017 Rave4 XLE.  I love this car.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,13-03-2017,Q1 2017,0.948,5, Small trunk.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,23-03-2017,Q1 2017,0.3612,3, First let me say I owned a 2013 Ford Motor Corp Escape SEL before buying this vehicle.  That being said my Escape had more options on it for the price point.  I have never owned a Toyota Motor Corp before and I found the appearance of the RAV4 inviting.  The 2017 RAV4's only offer a 4 cylinder engine the 2016's offered a 6 cylinder.  The SE comes with the ECO/Sport modes.  ECO I'm getting about 29mpg Sport mode close to the same although engine is more peppy in sport mode.  There is plenty of power for merging onto highways and for passing in my opinion.  Interior is quiet and road/engine noise into the cabin is minimal.  The SE's suspension is more stiff a little more rough than I'd like but ok.  Almost no vehicle lean going around corners electric steering feels fine also.  Stereo is great!  Cabin speakers more than adequate better than my Escape's.  The seats are not as comfortable as I would have expected a bit disappointing!  The headlights and tail lights have the LED trim which looks very nice.  Great visibility at night with just low beams on!  Back seat is spacious cargo area fine.  The only thing I wish I had is memory button for drivers seat and a power passenger seat.  Other than that it's a nice vehicle but I only have a little over 550 miles on it so far.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,30-03-2017,Q1 2017,0,5, I've had the car for 3 month. So far I love the car. I read the reviews by the pros and I think they have no idea what they are talking about. The acceleration on I-95 is great. The car is very comfortable. My gas economy is outstanding. Nothing appears cheap in the interior as I read in some of the reviews. I had a compact Chevrolet Sonic prior to this car. The Sonic had twice as much trunk space as this car. The only problem that I ran into is insurance. I'm 62 and a perfect driving record. With all the advanced safety features in this vehicle my insurance went up $166 a year. WHY!!! I thought it would go down. The only features that I added to the car was painted on pinstripes and tinted windows. I purchased the vehicle for $17100 (CVT).,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,04/01/2017,Q2 2017,0.9602,5, A decent discount at Toyota Motor Corp led me to consider this along with others in the class (Fit Focus Cruze)... I'm very happy with my decision I'm just loving this car.   ,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,04/11/2017,Q2 2017,0.6783,3, This is really a great car easy to drive and great on gas. The cabin is nice and the materials look and feel terrific for its class The ride is rather firm but never too harsh. The seats are fantastic!!! The power is more than enough for normal driving and I have never found the engine noise too loud. Transmission is silky smooth.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,15-04-2017,Q2 2017,-0.126,4, The Toyota Motor Corp Yaris IA  is a nice  compact car.  I love the look adn style of it. As a mom I wish it was a little more room from the in between the the front and backseats and more space from the seats to the doors. Overall it's a nice ride indeed. I'm not used to it yet but the push start button is pretty cool and the camera comes on where you are backing up to see others around you.   I got this car at Riverview  Toyota Motor Corp in Mesa Az. I had a awesome gentlemen name Milo take me around to look at cars. He was also nice to entertain my little one while completing the paperwork. A great guy who knows how to get things done fast. Thanks Milo!!  I enjoyed this location as they have a play areas for the kids which is needed when you have to be there a few hours to get everything done.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,16-04-2017,Q2 2017,-0.9575,3, Wife and I test-drove the RAV-4.  We were satisfied with the ride quality and performance but both felt that the interior design felt very generic and bland compared to say... the Volkswagen Motor Corpwagon Tiguan and the Honda Motor Corp CR-V.  Trunk space is adequate but the driver's seat felt cramped and back seats won't be very comfortable for full-size adults unless you have the physique of a female gymnist.   Nothing against Toyota Motor Corp because they make great vehicles and I own a Tundra which I will take to my grave but Toyota Motor Corp engineers didn't exactly hit a home run when they re-designed it.  It's more like a base hit.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,20-04-2017,Q2 2017,0.993,5, My 2007 Yaris sedan just rolled past 231000 miles without ever being in the shop for repairs and costs less than $15000 when I purchased it new..Regular Toyota Motor Corp Care maintenance is the key.  I still get 38-40 mpg and you can bet if it ever lays down and dies on me my next car will be a Yaris.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,21-04-2017,Q2 2017,-0.7077,4, very good fuel economy. Manual shifts different,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,05/03/2017,Q2 2017,0.9661,5, First and foremost; this is a Toyota Motor Corp built by Mazda in Mexico. That's a plus for value performance pricing and design. The pros  are many and I'll list a few. The 6 speed manual transmission ranks with BMW for ease of shifting and overall responsiveness. The car handles as well or probably far better than any car in its class. Fuel economy is on the fringe of a hybrid. I get 32 to 35 in town and 44+ on the highway. You'll hear the car is sluggish on hills and while passing at high speeds. I can only believe comments like that are based on the automotive or not shifting at higher RPMs  (3200 to 3600). If you shift at lower RPMs the car does not receive adequate torque and may seem sluggish. It's not. The car's safety features are first in its class and one can expect a five star crash rating. It comes with a myriad of standard features; many you'll pay more for in other cars in its class. The information system is easy to use and provides you a wide range of necessary information and entertainment features. I could add many more pros but choose to provide you with a few cons. This is a four seater. The center back seat is virtually useless. The car's digital tachometer with its analogue design is small and hard to read in direct sunlight. This is a minor issue because with the manual transmission it's a necessity. In the center of the tach you'll see two numbers; the gear you're in and the gear Toyota Motor Corp suggests you should be in. The suggested gear must be based upon fuel economy not performance. It has you shifting into 6th gear at 47 MPH...absurd. In summary this is not a sub compact. It's the same size as the Civic. Making it a compact. I've owned several cars including numerous BMWs a Lexus and Jaguar. For $16500 to $20000 finding a better car especially with an exceptional 6 speed manual will be virtually impossible.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,05/10/2017,Q2 2017,0.9212,4, The Prius Prime Premium trim offers the best price point from the 3 trim options available for the Prime. As a plug in hybrid the Prime is eligible for a $1500 rebate from the state of California and up to $4502 in tax credits. A full electric charge consistently gives me over 30 miles of city driving. The hybrid system is also impressive and I have been able to get an average of 87 mpg on a 10 mile round trip in the city. Overall after 1600 miles driven the car is averaging 73mpg. The electric engine has a good pick up while the hybrid system is a lot more sluggish when starting from 0. The big touchscreen wireless charging and Bluetooth integration with your smartphone are other nice features. On the negative side the Prime only seats 4 passengers doesn't carry a spare tire but has a flat repair kit instead and has a reduced cargo space when compared to the regular Prius.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,14-05-2017,Q2 2017,0.9552,4," Have had this car about a month now. I use almost every day. At first I thought the low power and cvt would bother me but car is sp smooth I hardly notice it anymore. Power in ""sport"" mode is actually adequate for everyday driving. Mpg are where they should be. Handling is where this car exceeds. I take off ramps and corners pretty fast and this car does not back down. It hugs the road pretty well. I don't regret buying this car especially with the deal I got on it.",,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,17-05-2017,Q2 2017,0.7717,5,The car's performance continues to impress me. It isn't slow and if you have the manual and downshift when it makes sense it's not slow on hills or on highways.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,19-05-2017,Q2 2017,0.9707,5, The awesome smooth ride safety features and cargo space drew me to the car and the great gas mileage keeps me in it.  It is not a fast car tho it is quick enough for me. The price/ value is great.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,19-05-2017,Q2 2017,0.661,4, The dash if you have sunglasses on cannot be seen very well. Can't turn the panel lights up high enough to see speed. And I wear light tint.

LE only comes with black interior seats sit well but shows all the dirt. Headlights at night are not as bright as they should be even on high beam. Should of got the xle would have been worth the price. Don't invest in cargo cover the window tint is so dark you can't see inside anyway.

Toyota Motor Corp,2017,21-05-2017,Q2 2017,0.9468,4," This is the bomb and since this would be the third prius in our lifetime it's appropriate as having exp three other gens  or models to explain the differences  for instance prius c we had this model virtually a month after it showed up at dealer showrooms. City it is spectacular bar none but we ended up moving back to the midwest and in the interim  drive many freeway miles horrible highway ride noisy to the point of wanting to jump out and abandon shop! Next was the 3rd Gen boxey and bulkey super fuel economy but horrible line of sight then back to what we'd had long time back the virtuous 2nd gen  wow just a beast goes & goes.  Now here I've just test driven the pentulimate expression and design of what a super cargo friendly sedan style ride can be plus ""wow"" factor  60+mpg  all day long!

I think that I have actually gotten more than 25 miles of range on the electric charge and have spent over 80% of my time in EV mode--  I have driven about 150 miles and the indicator on my gas tank range has gone down less than 30 miles!!,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,28-05-2017,Q2 2017,0.2449,5, We've only had this a few days but it lives up to the hype. I love the advanced safety features such as lane control sonar and back-up camera. Infinitely adjustable driver's seat is great for long trips. The best part is the driving range for in town trips. We can plug it in overnight and generally use only the battery around town saving the hybrid engine for longer trips.,,,,

I fly back into my seat every time I accelerate its crazy. I always take risks in this car. I turn when other people normally think it is too risky. I've almost totaled my car a few times but it was way worth it. And that blind spot monitoring is great and always tells me when I'm out of my lane. And that pedestrian detection has saved countless lives from my driving. I personally also like to floor it to its top speed of 84mph on the highway SO FAST.

Toyota Motor Corp,2017,27-11-2016,Q4 2017,0.9836,5, I have been driving 2017 Model for a week. It looks great. It is fun to drive and good MPG between 50 to 70 miles per 1KG of hydrogen. On the downside hydrogen stations are still limited and only available in California. Hydrogen is also expensive though Toyota Motor Corp offers free hydrogen for three years.

Toyota Motor Corp,2017,12/11/2016,Q4 2017,0.8934,5, Have had the car for a week and am really surprised by the performance the ride and how quiet the interior is. Fueling was easy but if Toyota Motor Corp wasn't paying for the fuel it would have been $58 for 3.5kg of hydrogen. There is virtually no storage space except a small glove compartment and the door slots for bottles. The center console has the wireless phone charger which is handy but eliminates storage for a few things. But that not withstanding it is an outstanding and solidly built car.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,12/11/2016,Q4 2017,0.9922,5,    The hybrid-competitive and in some cases hybrid-besting gas mileage is what moved me to pull the trigger on the iA.  The base 4 cylinder Camry might get into the low 30's mpg with conservative driving which as many reviewers have noted is subpar for today's fuel efficient sedans.  While the iA even before the engine was fully broken in was giving me an average of 40.5 mpg of mixed highway and city driving.  Cruising along at a highway speed between 55-65 mph the fuel mileage calculator shows a stable 50+ mpg well above the EPA rating of 42 mpg.  After I used up the first full tank of gas that came with the car when I bought it I reset my trip meter to see how many miles I would clock before having to fill up again.  The low fuel light did not come on until I had 450 miles showing on the trip meter.  I looked in the manual to see how many gallons are left in the tank when the low fuel indicator light comes on and it's about 2 gallons.  I tested that and went on for another 52 miles to get a total of 502.3 miles on the trip meter.  When I topped off the tank I noticed that I did not reach the 12 (11.9) gallon limit which means that I still had close to half a gallon of gas still left in the tank.  Mind you that I am getting this gas mileage in a regular gasoline 1.5 liter engine with zero assistance from any hybrid technology all the while running the AC intermittently and defrosters in December.  The reported gas mileage of the iA is legitimate and even easily exceeds the EPA ratings.  You will not be disappointed with the fuel economy.     I swear that for around $5000 less than a 2017 Camry LE I do not find the iA to be much if any noisier at all save for some light whistling coming in near the top of the driver side window sill at hwy speeds on a windy day.  Overall the iA is very nimble and even fun to drive safe gets unbelievable gas mileage without the price and worry over hybrid tech has handsome enough looks and is certainly comfortable for a single person or married couple with small children.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,12/12/2016,Q4 2017,0,5, After looking to replace VW TDI that's part of emissions lawsuit with a car that's truly eco-friendly I settled on the Mirai and leased one on Friday 12/9/16. The current lease deal of $349/month + tax required just shy of $5000 in total drive off which is entirely covered by the CA clean air rebate program which currently still has funds available for fiscal year 2016-2017. The $15000 card that Toyota Motor Corp includes with the lease to cover hydrogen refueling should be about twice as much as I'll ultimately spend (note that insurance costs more for the Mirai than my VW so some of the monthly fuel savings is eaten up by that). I don't want to pay cost for electricity/charging an EV at work and being able to get ~300 mile range by fueling in 5-10 minutes was a lot more appealing to me than going BEV route even if hydrogen fueling stations are fairly spare (although should get better in 2017). In terms of the actual driving experience it's a lot more fun to drive than a Prius or the new Prius Prime (which I had initially put down a $500 deposit). It accelerates quickly has a really nice interior and the exterior look has also grown on me. I think we can all take concrete actions to help limit climate change and supporting the development of fuel cell vehicles and infrastructure is one way to do that. A few days in this has been a cool and easy to operate car that's been fun to drive! Definitely recommended!!,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,19-12-2016,Q4 2017,0.8292,4,It?s my first CVT and I was wary about some reviews on performance which I can?t relate to ? the acceleration is more than adequate for me on highways and surface streets and the ride is incredibly smooth especially for the price of this car.  I?ve already had to drive in snow rain and strong winds and it has handled the conditions very capably.  As others noted you?ll likely turn off the lane departure alert.  The display is intuitive though I wish they had a digital speed/mph display setting in the center one. Don?t expect the fuel economy of a Prius but it?s fairly good ? I?ve gotten about 36 mpg.  First hatchback I?ve had in a long time and LOVE the convenience of being able to carry big stuff without needing a big car!  I got the ?pop? spring green color - more like yellow - and hope I love that color a long time because I?d really like this to be my dependable little ride for years to come.,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,19-12-2016,Q4 2017,0,5, If you sit inside of the more expensive Corolla or even a Camry and get a feel for their infotainment system and touchscreen interface and controls and then go inside of the iA and use its center control dial system and gorgeous upright 7-inch  display I dare say that you would heavily consider the iA over the Corolla and yes even the Camry.  It works so well and feels like it was intended for a Mercedes or BMW.  The control inputs show up FAST on the screen and that backup camera is incredibly sharp - I can make out individual blades of grass and pebbles of gravel.  Yes outward visibility on the iA is very good and with that 7-inch backup camera image quality parking is extremely easy.  No the perfectly positioned upright 7-inch screen does NOT get washed out by sun glare whatsoever.  Push-button start is a great feature for convenience and if you prefer the silence of not having keys jingle over bumps or swinging and scraping your steering column.  You have to pay for that by going up to the highest trim level in the Corolla and Camry models but EVERY iA comes with push button start as a standard feature.  As aforementioned the iA is really more Mazda than Toyota Motor Corp and when it comes to seat geometry and comfort this seat hands down is more comfortable than the power adjustable seat on a 2017 Toyota Motor Corp Camry LE and certainly the absolute torture device of a driver seat in the 2015 RAV4 that I had to trade in last year for its discomfort and my friend's 2016 Corolla which pushes your shoulders in and strains your head forward in a way similar to the RAV4.  Even though the Camry seat has power adjustable lumbar support it is placed too high towards the middle of my back and no matter how much I raise and lower the seat the lumbar support fails to give support where I need it.  Whereas the general shape and architecture of the iA seat is more comfortable even without a manually adjustable lumbar support feature and I have room to spread and rest my shoulders back.  Keep in mind that I have a touchy back after suffering a joint sprain at the L2 and L3 vertebrae several years ago.  However despite my back problem I still think that the iA seat provides better overall support compared to the stiffer flatter seats in the Camry.  It's also worth mentioning that you can actually rest your head back on the headrest at an upright angle and not feel like the headrest is pushing your head and neck forward like so many other vehicles do these days especially like the RAV4 and Corolla do.   I tested my perception of the seat comfort of both the iA and Camry by going on 100+ mile test drives over some terribly bumpy roads at highway and in-town speeds and still even after owning the car for 3 weeks now the iA is a very comfortable car.  Plus the thick waffle weave fabric on the Camry seats seems overdone and looks like it will trap dirt very easily and be difficult to (keep) clean.  ,,,,
Toyota Motor Corp,2017,25-12-2016,Q4 2017,-0.6299,5, I have owned over a hundred vehicles and I have to say this vehicle has a lot of bang for the buck. I am impressed with the interior quality it is nicer than my RAV 4 hybrid.  I purchased the vehicle for $16800. You cannot touch other vehicles for the price. I have owned many Toyota Motor Corp products and you cannot beat the quality. I am very satisfied with the engine/transmission combo. I am not sure how the CVT performs but the manual is great with this engine. The ride is superb. It is a great looking vehicle and the spring green color is uplifting during these drab winter days. I love all the standard safety features that Toyota Motor Corp now includes with all their vehicles for 17. I tried out all the competition before buying  they were more expensive and quality or size was not to my liking. I am happy with the 1.8 in this vehicle  great performance with great economy. I would not want a bigger engine. I had the 2.4 in my TC and XB and the mileage could have been better. I look for good looks reliability economy resale value nice ride competent handling and safety and hatchback versatility this vehicle delivers.,,,,

Volkswagen Motor Corp,2009,18-09-2015,Q3 2009,-0.8246,1, I love driving this car... I've even posted glowing reviews on Facebook about how great it drives on the open highway on twisting roads and in the city.   But at 89000 miles I've spent more money on maintenance than I spent in 250000 miles on my last car a Toyota Motor Corp Camry.     Unfortunately the tales of woe on Edmunds seem to be true....  replaced the intake manifold replaced a door handle had many lights burn out replaced water pump thermostat and cooling fans.   And a few other things.    Check engine light is glowing about 20% of the time.     I'm very sad about needing to give up on this car but I can't imagine the coming problems if I hold onto it.    It might work out OK for those who drive fewer miles but I need my car for some long distance trips.   Ultimately reliability trumps performance.      VW really needs to deal with this.

I am so sad to get rid of this car. It is stylish and performs but I have poured more than $4k into in in 3 years and I am now facing needing to replace the engine because there is no compression.

It is not a small squeak but a loud embarrassing screech.  When running errands I have to purposely look for parking spots where I will not have to reverse.  Really inconvenient.  The dealer says it is normal which I find unacceptable.  I see on other forums other VW users are experiencing the same issue.  This will be my last VW and I cannot wait to unload this one when I can.,,,,

People warned me with buying a VW but I was like 'how can it be so bad if so many people have them?'. Well sadly I am finding out. I love the car but never imagined having probs with a car that's only a year old. How can VW shoot for achieving ,1 car sales if they make junk? Well this is definitely my last VW thinking of trading it for a Rav4 before I have to start paying for the repairs. Sorry to say I did have hopes of 6 years with this car. ,,,

Seating is excellent as well as visibility. I am getting consistent 25 mpg combo hwy/city taking it easy with 6K miles to date. Only complaint is brake squeal when backing up after car sits a couple of hours. VW can't or won't resolve and it appears this is common with the brand. Talked with dealership and customer care -say brakes are to specifications so have a nice day. I told them how come I never had this problem with any other vehicles in the past.

Called the police as I thought someone may have thrown something that hit the window. Not so. Took to dealer where they prepared to fix the prob only to find that they called people in from Detroit Corperate to have a look see... the next day!

Volkswagen Motor Corp,2012,12/04/2011,Q4 2012,0.9106,4.625, This is my 3rd TDI. I've owned a 2003 Jetta TDI (5 spd) 2010 Jetta Sportwagen TDI (DSG). Neither of the newer models could reach the 47MPG that the 2003 Jetta got. That said the 2010 was a great car (39 MPG) but I've been waiting for the Passat TDI for the size and comfort. Both of which are 5's in my book. I've had the Passat now for 2 weeks and about 1000 miles. Averaging 41.5 MPG with mostly commuting at 70-75 MPH. Very nice car with one exception. At higher speeds the car seems to wander slightly as if you were driving through gusty winds requiring small steering inputs. A bit annoying i might add.,,,,

Volkswagen Motor Corp,2013,09/08/2015,Q3 2013,0.8514,4, I will start with the only thing that could be improved and that is the transmission. I have the DSG transmission and it is great and refined at normal driving speed (15 mph plus) However it is a bit rough when coasting to a stop driving through a parking lot and other slow situations. It seems there is more low end torque than the transmission knows how to handle and when it downshifts from 3rd to 2nd to 1st gear it is not as smooth as other non-diesel non DSG cars the dealer checked the transmission and all was good no defects were found. Everything else this car aces fuel economy is off the charts build quality is what you expect from VW which is excellent no squeaks or rattles the interior materials are solid and not cheap ergonomics are great and I love the no nonsense designs of the controls. The car handles great and the 2.0 turbo diesel has loads of torque which makes passing and merging into a freeway a breeze (no drama it just builds speed) Road noise is better than other cars I've tested on this seGM Motor Corpent and great for long journeys front seats are very comfortable and there is great leg room for the back occupants (I'm 6' tall). Trunk space is actually surprisingly good and mine came with a first aid kit. When it comes to fuel economy this car is a star especially on the highway I never get less than 550 miles per tank and have gotten as much as 610 in a trip from Florida to Michigan. In conclusion I highly recommend this car to anyone. I've owned this car for almost 3 years and I bought it used with only 5k miles on the odometer.,,,,

Husband owned about 1cars since we married 24 years ago. Passat not as good as Jetta sorry to say. Never had any maintenance issues with Jetta.

The fit and finish is EL CHEAPO. Flimsy upholstery and lots of hard plastic. Rear seats are ""pretend"" it should be classified as a 2+2...Interior components fail having seat railings and the seatbelt changed under warranty.

Volkswagen Motor Corp,2015,14-02-2016,Q1 2015,0.8765,5,The side mirrors could include the corner oval that would help see cars right next to you in the blind spot but most cars will probably have electronic warning indicators in the near future.  The trans goes to neutral when you come to a stop so you CANNOT put your left foot on the brake and your right on the accelerator to pull into another lane in heavy traffic.  (As soon as you take your foot off the brake nothing is happening). It's a trade off for better fuel economy-less resistance on the engine when stopped.

Volkswagen Motor Corp,2015,25-07-2015,Q3 2015,0.9592,5,There are four things I've asked myself about this car but I still give it a 5-star rating and two thumbs up. First why no USB port?... just weird.  I mean they don't even have an iPhone 5 adapter.  If no USB port then they should send an inventory of adapters to dealers to outfit each car. Second why no heated seats on the S trim when even the base Jetta with cloth has them?  I live in Colorado and use the heated seats from time to time.  Now I'll have to pay $450 for a local shop to install them (with most of the cost in labor).  Third (and this applies to all Golfs in general) why not just put a soft plastic upper panel on the back seat passenger doors and match up the quality of everywhere else in the car?  My prior JSW had that.  Lastly I've heard the reasons why they dropped the IRS from the GSW and Golf TDI to accommodate emissions and I find it tuned okay but it just bothers me when I think about it.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2015,31-07-2015,Q3 2015,0.971,5, This car is miles ahead of the previous Jetta wagon. I opted for the optional lighting package really gives the car a high end feel.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2015,31-07-2015,Q3 2015,0,5, Seeing only two consumer reviews on Edmunds at this point is kind of disappointing for how great this car really is.  I have the S trim so now there's an SEL and SE and an S review. I wasn't willing to buy up to the SE trim at this time but I find a lot of value in the car even at the S level.  I had bought the 2015 Golf TSI SE as well earlier in the year but kept finding that with 3 kids and a dog and road travel the extra space was needed.  However in owning the SE things like the sunroof Fender audio heated seats RSWs etc. were all nice but I really liked how solid and quiet the Golf was to drive.  It made driving easy and that's what opened me up to try the S trim.  It's a real shame this is a niche car all because of the influence of the truck/SUV on American mind sets.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2015,14-08-2015,Q3 2015,0.9296,5, I've been driving gas and diesel VWs for 35 years with my previous ride being a 312k mile 2002 Jetta TDI that's never had a major problem and still runs great but time to move on.  I considered a Passat but bigger than I needed and drove like a large car meh styling.  I'd considered the now discontinued Jetta Sportwagen but it had the lesser version of the TDI blob styling and just couldn't get excited.  This new Golf Sportwagen snuck up on me going from being unaware of it to in my garage in about two weeks.,,,,

Volkswagen Motor Corp,2015,09/08/2015,Q3 2015,0,3,Even though the Golf has historically been positioned as their low end model series in recent years it has enjoyed a rep as their performance series with classic VW Euro handling more sporty everything and even higher end interiors.  ,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2015,18-09-2015,Q3 2015,0.933,5,Favorite feature? It checks all the boxes!  - Room like an SUV - Drives like a FUN car - Can haul everything you own  - Gets Prius MPG (45 highway) with diesel - Feels luxurious inside: not like a Toyota Motor Corp/Subaru you got loaded but more like an Audi/BMW if that makes sense - More fun than any sub $50K SUV out there - The pleather/leatherette is actually really nice - I can't think of what this car is missing there is detail in everything they did here - I dare someone to find such a nice balance of a car elsewhere ,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2015,07/07/2016,Q3 2015,0.7003,5, Best car I've ever owned! The utility of an suv the economy of a compact all in a fun to drive package! And only about $20.000 great value!!!!,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2015,07/07/2016,Q3 2015,0.296,5,"I really wanted a snappy handling car like my old Jetta and previous GTI so as stated above the Golf series is the closest you can get in their line-up.  This thing handles much better than a Passat if not quite my older VWs.  The S version has only 16"" wheels but my experience is that is good enough with good rubber.   ",,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2015,13-07-2016,Q3 2015,0.3612,5, I love my Passat.  The quality is far better than what is being offered by competitors.  The drive is amazing.  This is my 3rd Diesel VW product.  I drive over 30K miles a year and have never had more than routine maintenance performed.  NEVER one quality issue in over 300K miles driven.  And the service is great.  Free loaners they wash your car and the intervals are 10K miles not 5 or less like most cars.  By far the most economical car to own compared to the competition.  My wife was a Honda Motor Corp girl but she is a convert and also has a VW now.  You cannot go wrong with a VW diesel.  ,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2015,18-08-2016,Q3 2015,0.9496,5," I bought my Sportwagen diesel 3 weeks before they announced the diesel scam. I got an incredible deal on both my trade in and the new car. I soon found out why. But! This is a great car. Lots of room for kids and dogs. It handles beautifully on the road. Turning is very smooth unlike anything I've ever felt. Mileage on diesel fuel is outstanding. I average 40 mpg in the city. On the highway however I get about 50 mpg.  My fuel costs have dropped dramatically. I have and paid for ""pulse"" on the third brake which routinely shows up as broken on my info screen now I just ignore it. I love this car it's easy to get in and out of and completely fills my need for a vehicle. I have tossed around the idea of the buyback but I love this car so much I can't find anything else I want. I consider myself very luck to have the diesel. Winter in Wisconsin has proven to be no issue for the Diesel engine with the right fuel.  So I'm 100% happy with this little wagon!",,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2015,25-09-2016,Q3 2015,-0.4023,5,Also expensive for a car in this seGM Motor Corpent.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2015,14-10-2015,Q4 2015,0.25,5, Bought a new fully loaded diesel sportwagen. First and foremost: This car is MUCH faster than its HP suggests. The diesel pulls effortlessly and is very quiet. The gas engine is good but this engine is something I've never experienced before and I come from a 2015 GTI (this is our second VW). The panoramic sunroof makes it feel like your car is almost a convertible. Diesel is so fuel-efficient it is crazy. I was afraid of the UREA scrub but its like adding windshield washer fluid - so simple. The reason I was so drawn to VW in the first place - it feels MUCH more expensive than its price tag suggests and has a soul to it. Its not boring like the cute 'ute competition.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2015,15-10-2015,Q4 2015,0,5, We were looking at crossovers since we've recently started a family but they were all so meh in test drives. We ended up test driving this one because it was at the lot next door and we feel just incredibly lucky that we did. We LOVE it. It's zippy and fun with a crazy amount of cargo space (comparable or greater than most crossovers) and is very quiet and smooth to drive. We got the base model because it's already well equipped and the quality of the interior for the price is just incredible. I discovered that we actually like to have a car with subtle elegant styling instead a tank that looks like it's ready to go mud slinging. ,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2015,31-10-2015,Q4 2015,0.886,5, Quick enough solid feeling high end interior and fuel mileage that rocks! Fun to drive beautiful to look at. Mine had 40 miles on the odometer when I bought it and a few scratches on the interior but I saved 3500 off MSRP. VERY happy after 2800 miles.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2015,31-10-2015,Q4 2015,0.6249,4, Let me start by saying I traded in my midlife crisis Mustang for this car.  I am not disappointed in my decision.  I needed a sedan that would allow me to shuttle customers/coworkers/suppliers.  The backseat is the largest in its class the trunk holds plenty of luggage and the style is subtle but refined.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2015,23-11-2015,Q4 2015,0.6369,4," Beetle R-line front seats are not comfortable for those of us with ""larger bottoms"" and legs.  ",,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2015,10/06/2016,Q4 2015,0.3182,5,Update: After another 10000 miles I still enjoy the car.  I admit I have shopped a bit recently but cannot find another vehicle that goes toe to toe with the V6 Passat in this price range.  The closest thing I have found are a Mercedes E350 and a Lexus GS350 both of which are too much money for moving up a single Peggy on the board.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,20-01-2016,Q1 2016,0.6249,5, Considering the options available for this car this is definitely the best bang for the buck out there.  Especially when considering the other vehicles out there that offer dynamic suspension automatic w/ paddle shifters and a 0-60 in under 5 secs (they just don't exist in the Golf R's price range).  ,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,24-01-2016,Q1 2016,0.0516,5,All in all a versatile safe nimble car for young families that is a blast to drive. If you are shopping for a mid range car (the usual Ford Motor Corps Honda Motor Corps Toyota Motor Corps or Subarus) this is a must test drive car. Better yet test drive this right after your top choice from other brands before you decide. You don't have to drive a crossover for added cargo space and worry about rollover later.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,27-01-2016,Q1 2016,0.9698,3, It felt (and sounded) like we were riding on a corrugated surface - very disappointing!,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,02/06/2016,Q1 2016,0.962,5, Handles great. Awesome acceleration. Great electronics. A super fun car. You can tell that you're in a Golf because some items are obviously spec'd for a lower price point. However this much fun in a practical car cannot be passed up and the lower price point for a VW is still on par with a similarly priced BMW. Only an Audi/Mercedes will get you truly better interior.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,02/07/2016,Q1 2016,-0.3651,4,One of the things I have come to like a lot about the Golf R is that it is a wolf in sheep's clothing.  It doesn't beg for attention from law enforcement like other performance cars do.  Yet it has plenty of thrill providing capabilities whenever the mood strikes.  And it's practical enough for grocery shopping and driving my kids.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,02/08/2016,Q1 2016,0.9763,5,Couple of cons to keep in mind - noticeable Turbo lag at the start from 6 speed transmission but brilliant at highway speeds pretty much point and shoot at 4 5 and 6th speeds. No power seats for SE. Come on VW that is lame.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,04/07/2016,Q2 2016,0.8591,5,The Golf R is a total blast to drive.  It hangs in the curves like it's on rails.  Mine has the DCC suspension.  The best part is that the 'comfort' setting dials everything back enough that my mother would have no problems driving it.  Most of the time I leave the suspension dialed in to the 'race' setting which is fine for most of my driving.  ,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,05/03/2016,Q2 2016,0.9913,4,We've now been driving the new TSI Sportwagen for six months and remain very pleased. It is very comfortable and quiet for long trips and equally adept and nimble in urban driving. The cargo space is cavernous and significantly larger than most comparable small SUV's I've found I can actually carry more than several friends who own larger crossover vehicles. We have also found the driver assist features - something we felt we had no need for - and excellent bonus. VW's adaptive cruise control blind spot sensors and rear collision avoidance and back up camera are all excellent features and perform very well. Our only complaint is that the blind spot warning lights on the side mirrors are quite small and the same orange color as the turn signal indicators making them less visible than they should be.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,05/06/2016,Q2 2016,-0.9056,5, Love this car. FWIW I'm a 52 year old owner. I love Honda Motor Corps for their reliability. I got 275000 on my cr-v but was taken by the Volvo wagon at the auto show this year. However after reading several reviews and seeing a 10000 price difference between the se golf version and the Volvo I opted for the VW. To keep it short all I can say is it's awesome. Ride handling electronics is awesome. The only downside I see is getting in and out of the vehicle. Mind you I'm over 50 so a lower seat height is difficult compared to sliding your butt in on an SUV. Other than that  I get 10mpg more than my former vehicle fun driving and a quiet ride. Very satisfied.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,05/06/2016,Q2 2016,0.5719,5," Granted options are limited for the wagon enthusiasts out there but I'm really loving this car.  A lot.  I of course did my homework and drove several cars (Civic Accord Mazda 3 and others) before driving the Sportwagen.  Like the reviews elsewhere have noted it's a drivers car; crisp handling reasonable acceleration solid as a rock and very quiet on the inside.  That this combination of subtly surprising performance is cloaked in a wagon's exterior makes it all the more awesome.  It does seem to search for the right gear at low speeds (<15 mph) but it find it's groove quickly thereafter.  The 1.8 turbo is nicely suited to the car and it never feels under-powered.  The seats are also very comfortable front and back.  The resolution of the 5"" audio display/back-up camera is a little low but it's about the only gripe I have about the car.",,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,06/03/2016,Q2 2016,0.6124,5,Overall there is very little that I would have changed about this car.  My 1st complaint is the lack of a sun roof on the R model.  On the flip side a sunroof decreases chassis stiffness and moves the center of gravity higher both of which adversely affect handling.  Supposedly the Euro spec model comes with a sunroof.  I could have sacrificed a little in the handling dept. for a sunroof.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,06/11/2016,Q2 2016,0.9468,5, I needed a small low wagon so that my two aging golden retrievers could jump in the car easily but still have room. Edmonds price quote was lower than anyone else's and the dealership in st Augustine fl honored it! We are very happy with Edmonds the dealership and the car!,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,18-06-2016,Q2 2016,0.9542,5, We use it for a promotional car for our local business and people love it.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,25-06-2016,Q2 2016,0,5, I have owned it for a month with only 1500 miles and I must say I love this car. I love the DCC and the ability on how it controls the suspension. I honestly thought it was going to a small improvement but comfort really sorts out the bumpy roads quite well. Race mode makes things fun and tight. You can also custom Taylor the individual mode to how you like it too. Driving this car is very fun and I never want to get out of it. I also have a new BMW 328xi which use to be fun but now drives like a boat compared to the R. If you have the chance to buy one just get it. It's a fast fun rocket that sits 4 comfortable with a very nice refined interior. The DSG transmission shifts awesome and keeps the revs up high while in sport mode. I initially tested out a bunch of performance cars at first but once I drove the R it was a solid choice that ticked all the boxes perfect. All this package for under 40k was a great choice.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,07/02/2016,Q3 2016,0.9796,5,We also have a Subaru Forester and we find ourselves driving the Sportwagen whenever we can even on longer trips as it's a much more comfortable (and fun) ride.  We find that the cargo area actually holds more of our stuff than does the Subie.  The cargo area is deeper (though not taller) than the Forester and 4 of our travel suitcases fit perfectly in the back.  ,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,08/01/2016,Q3 2016,0.8638,5, This is definitely one of the most stunning and surprising cars that I've ever driven that has a high-quality Porsche feel to it when you're driving. I also love the fact that it is purely a sleeper car. For a mere $800 you can get a stage 1 tune and add almost an extra 100 HP and beat 2015 M3s Porsche Carreras and all sorts of muscle cars from Mustangs to Camaros and Dodge Chargers/Challengers. What's even more amusing is when you add some turns to the track and the Golf R will compete extremely well against anything you throw at it. Even with all the power the gas mileage is pretty high around 25/26 combined mpg (80% city 20% hwy).,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,15-08-2016,Q3 2016,0.9403,5, As owners of a much beloved 2012 Jetta Sportwagen TDI we thought long and hard about purchasing another VW. After evaluating many options we decided on a new 2016 Golf Sportwagen TSI as our second vehicle and as an eventual replacement of the TDI which was due to be returned. So we were in the unusual position of driving the TDI and this new TSI Sportwagens at the same time in a real apples-to-apples comparison. We LOVED our TDI but this new Golf Sportwagen simply slays it. A more responsive engine superior transmission smoother and quieter ride more controlled handling and braking (didn't think we could get better than the TDI) better interior and exterior fit and finish and a slightly higher seat position and more interior and storage space have already convinced us we made the right decision. I'm back to driving the TDI the past week as my wife is driving the new car and it feels like a tank in comparison. It didn't hurt that we got an incredible deal on a 2016 year-end close-out. On the con side the TSI has significantly less torque than the TDI but we're surprised that the TSI actually has better acceleration. ,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,22-08-2016,Q3 2016,0.9555,4," Love the car but not the gas mileage. Had a diesel so probably not fare to compare. Been told have to ""break it in some more"" before I can get better mileage. The USB port is in a tight space in the small storage space. Overall I do like the car a lot",,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,09/05/2016,Q3 2016,0.9881,5, Bargain for the roof rack.  What a ripoff at more than $300 extra.  Should be standard.  Good car overall comfortable maneuverable good mileage.  Love the huge roof rack,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,27-09-2016,Q3 2016,0.9989,5, Really happy with my 2016 GolfSportWagen LE.  First and foremost this is a driver's car (it is a Golf after all) -- it is responsive with the turbo kick at low RPM's it has great handling and a sporty (but still comfortable) ride it brakes very well and it really likes windy roads.  Second it has the versatility and functionality for a growing family -- tons of room in the cargo area with easy fold-down rear seats for putting a bike in.  Third it has great features -- panoramic sunroof CarPlay advanced safety features automatic cruise control etc.  It is well designed and has high end touches everywhere.  With all of this the car was a really good value.  The only cons I have found so far are: (A) small fuel tank -- ~13 gallons so the decent fuel economy is offset by having to refuel more often; (B) sometimes rough downshifts when coasting which lead to more engine braking than desired.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,21-12-2015,Q4 2016,0.8419,5, Great car ! Writing review after owning it for a month. Bought in SF Bay Area. Superb ride quality excellent visibility and top notch fit and finish. Plenty of cargo space. Definite looker like its cousin Audi A4 wagon. Drives as a German car for sure responsive very easy to drive and rock solid feel. Not yet rated for 2016 but based on 2015 Golf safety ratings from last year most likely a top IIHS safety pick and 5 star NHTSA safety rating since no change to body structure. ,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,27-12-2015,Q4 2016,0.9781,5, High performance meets practicality.  It's awesome.  Does everything as advertised.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,10/01/2016,Q4 2016,0.8658,4, Standout from the crowd.   This car is great value for money. Even base model is well equipped. I got an excellent discount during model year end sale  through Edmunds pricing option. Drives and handles like it's on rails and soaks up bumps easily. Excellent visibility all around. Trunk has tons of space and beats cargo room of any SUV. However back seat height and legroom could be improved. I also wish the seat bottoms provided a little more thigh support.  No automatic trunk release from inside the car.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,10/03/2016,Q4 2016,0.3752,3, I'm a big fan of blind spot monitors especially since they help in merging and shifting lanes on a busy freeway. I have these monitors on my Toyota Motor Corp Avalon and my Mazda 3 and these monitors work seamlessly. However the blind spot monitor on the VW golf is not only useless it is unsafe.  First of all the monitors are difficult to see partly because they're tiny and partly because the lights are not bright enough. Driving in bright sunlight makes it really difficult to see these lights. Secondly some genius in VW thought it would be a really smart idea to place blinking turn signal lights one inch from the blind spot monitors. As a result when I turn on my turn signal in preparation for a lane shift what I see in my side mirror are bright blinking lights not the blind spot monitor.  Seeing blinking lights makes one hesitate momentarily and that hesitation can spell the difference between a smooth lane change and an unsafe one. I've now deactivated the blind spot monitors on the VW Golf sportwagen  and instead angle my mirrors outwards to cover my blind spots. Since this is a safety issue I believe VW should address these problem. Right now I would settle for larger side mirrors without blind spot monitors.   I also find that the rear cross traffic alert is unreliable occasionally failing to detect vehicles moving behind me. For a driver to trust a cross traffic alert system the system has to work every single time. I've also deactivated adaptive cruise control because it makes the car decelerate suddenly when the vehicle in front makes a turn. This happens even when there is ample space between vehicles and slowing down is not necessary. I chose to spend the extra cash for these safety features because I was buying this car for my daughter but now I feel I just wasted my money on these features.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,10/08/2016,Q4 2016,0.9966,5, Two cars were in my final list; the R and a Focus RS. Here in Canada (Nova Scotia...had to use a Maine zip code to submit my review) the RS is $8k (!) more than the R. So the R was the obvious selection...and I am not disappointed. Definitely understated WRT its exterior...and I'm fine with that. Folks who know cars come up an ask me about routinely. It is very quick...especially when moving from 2nd 3rd thru 4th. Brakes are outstanding. Got a chance to enjoy the 4Motion in the snow the day it arrived (March 2016) and through out the remainder of the winter...also excellent on dry pavement when you are working the corners hard. Interior is consistent with VW/Audi...logical and good quality. Lots of soft surfaces. The exhaust tone is a bit pedestrian but not a big issue for me. One item of ongoing irritation - Android Auto. Quite unreliable - only connects to my phone after multiple efforts. Once it does it's great (Spotify Google Maps) but it should be seamless. Summary for someone living in Canada there aren't may vehicles that can touch the R's performance/$ ratio.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,10/10/2016,Q4 2016,0.7174,5,Engine is alright but the transmission is completely out of its element at speeds between 20 and 60 mph. If you keep it in drive it will have you lugging the engine up a hill in 6th gear at 30 mph.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,19-10-2016,Q4 2016,0.128,5,On a positive note the ride is excellent (when the car isn't vibrating) the interior is great and the seats are comfortable.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,20-10-2016,Q4 2016,0.8915,5, It's perfect for someone wanting a small commuter car with lots of room when needed. Cargo space is great. The ride is comfortable. The car drives well and the tornado red is the perfect color. I love it!,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,22-10-2016,Q4 2016,0.9775,2, Great car if you're not worried about quality and reliability issues. I had to bring the car to the dealer for three separate repairs before I hit 10000 miles. Twice for a leaking sunroof and I've also had issues with vibration at highway speeds window squeaks and peeling paint on the rear bumper.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,22-10-2016,Q4 2016,0.8516,5, My VW Beetle Convertible is perfect in the city for urban driving while also being remarkably comfortable and well suited to the highway for long trips.  It has just enough features to make it feel modern without going overboard and having too much gimmickry and engineering.  The styling is excellent interior room is abundant (even for tall drivers like me) and performance is peppy and smooth as silk.  I regard this car as underrated and under-appreciated by the reviewers.  Anyone who drives it for even one day will be grinning from ear to ear.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,27-10-2016,Q4 2016,0.5267,4,MPG isn't quite as good as advertised.  And will get slightly worse if you add the APR stage 1 kit (even though APR claims otherwise) - my combined MPG is around 22.  However gas milage is still darn respectable considering the performance.  Adding the stage 1 APR kit drops the 0-60 time to under 4 secs.  And keeping the foot off the gas pedal becomes an exercise in will power.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2016,17-11-2016,Q4 2016,-0.8338,4, Got this after my lease on Sportwagen TDI expired. Two major gripes about the car -  automatic transmission is jerky when car slows down to about 30-20mph and right before stopping. As if it doesn't know what to do downshifting gears abruptly. Unpleasant. Second - after about 5 months of driving it noticed a sizable stain on the roof (moonroof) liner right where it meets rear tailgate. It has overtime became slightly less than a foot long and is as wide as the whole roof. Car is being taken care of right now by the dealer who is doing great job keeping me updated on the progress. But it seems like serious manufacturing defect due to improper welding  around moonroof. A smaller thing but also annoying. When accelerating if I press the pedal quickly nothing happens at all for the first half a second or so then it suddenly jumps. There is a certain amount of lag and it seems to become more and more noticeable as I drive the car more. Everything else about the car is fantastic I was able to hit 40 mpg on my way to work during 22 mile drive many times. Usually if driven carefully the car achieves 35mpg no problem. Very spacious and sporty at the same time. Interior quality is so much better than many Japanese cars and design is more subtle minimalistic just right for me.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,01/01/2017,Q1 2017,0.9685,5, Not quite as nice as my 2009 TDI but very good for the money.  Fun to drive.  Great features.  Manual is very nice.   Mileage is exceptional for non-Diesel.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,01/01/2017,Q1 2017,0.9784,5,Update: One thing I have noticed in the almost 10k miles of owning the vehicles is that the paint is far too delicate. The piano black decorative trim on the door B-pillars is liquid and even fingers leave marks that require abrasives to remove. If you are very picky about your vehicle upkeep and like it perfect like me be prepared to work hard for it!,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,01/01/2017,Q1 2017,0.9873,5, Great road handling.  Outstanding in snow/ice.  I love the iPhone display on the car's display (car play).  Not great acceleration but I didn't expect or need that.  Shifting gears is a little sluggish and there's a barely audible transmission noise shifting in the lower gears.  I'm getting a little better mileage than I expected (22-25 around town) and 33-34 highway.  Still early but I love the car so far.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,01/03/2017,Q1 2017,0.9966,5, The Sport trim offers you the best value in your GTI I feel. It is almost like the Autobahn compared to the SE just spend the $1500 or so more you won't regret it. I got a great deal on my GTI Sport. I will get the negatives out of the way now since the list is still really short after 1 month of ownership. There are no fog lamps on this trim level. This was quite troublsome the other night in a white-out snow. THe road holding wasn't the issue visibility was and fog lamps would've been really nice to have. You get the lighting package however which gives you the lovely and aggressive looking xenon headlights and LED DRL lights. Ties the front together nicely every GTI should have these. The adaptive lighting when turning at slower speeds is also much better than in was on my 2012 Golf TDI. Quicker to respond quicker to turn off and better at throwing the light. Second negative rides a bit harsh I feel for normal driving the last generation of GTI was a bit more comfy in a straight line or during casual driving however it also didn't turn like the Mk7. This car's new MQB platform from Audi is a MAJOR improvement in the Golf/GTI lineup and handling is bliss in a corner when you throw it around a bit. Sharp direct and almost like an extension of your arms when you hold at 3 & 9'o clocks. Also you could teach someone with getting comfortable with a manual transmission or at least the principles of it. Super easy clutch almost too easy I plan to do some aftermarket work in there anyways but for the masses it is decent. I have had one defect so far a piece of cloth that forms the backing of the rear armrest fell off and the armrest is back-ordered minor detail. Can't even see it unless you look in from the rear. I am not concerned with it right now. The positives go on and on and on. But I will let you find out for yourself! ,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,01/04/2017,Q1 2017,0,5, The car is only a month old for me but I absolutely love driving it.  I commute 100 miles a day and this car makes it much less of a chore.  Acceleration on the highway is amazing and the nimble handling makes it a blast to drive around town.  The only knock that I would give it is that I am struggling to get close to the advertised MPG.  That might be attributed to a heavy foot though.  :-),,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,01/05/2017,Q1 2017,0.5994,5,The SE package is the only trim offering this year but valued well with every 2016 SEL amenity sans some front lighting features. ,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,14-01-2017,Q1 2017,0.9691,2, I'm a former Passat TDi owner and sold my Passat back to VW. I decided to be a loyal customer and bought a new 2017 Passat. I'm so disappointed in my purchase because I told myself to buy the Accord especially after dealing with the TDI issue. I went ahead anyway and purchased a new Passat SE with technology package. Don't Do It!!!! The front seat hurts my back as I commute daily for work about 60 miles a day. The pickup and transmission lag stinks. Oh My Sunroof switch Just broke after owning the car for a little over a month. I wish I could return the car and buy a Honda Motor Corp Accord.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,14-01-2017,Q1 2017,-0.5095,5, I owned 3 Tribeca Subaru and 1 Audi Q5; they were too small.  The Touareg is just right; it doesn't bump my head on the lift gate. There is just my wife and me and for us it is a perfect fit.  I was surprised at the good acceleration and disappointed with the low end torque since my two other Touaregs were the 3.0 diesels.  I think the air resources agencies have an aim to get rid of diesels.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,19-01-2017,Q1 2017,0.7717,5, So happy with my purchase only thing wrong with it is that I didn't make it sooner.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,21-01-2017,Q1 2017,-0.3149,5, I was one of the early buyers of this model ordered it from the factory fully loaded and took delivery in October. I'm a guy who loves to drive and having owned many other European models including Audi Porsche Land Rover Volvo and Mercedes I find VW the right mix of quality attention to detail simplicity technology and driving enjoyment. VW bought out my Jetta Sportwagen TDI regrettably giving that up as I'm a fan of diesels but a bigger fan of the environment. I considered many other models including hybrids however having owned Asian hybrids in the past including Honda Motor Corp Toyota Motor Corp and Subaru I find the cars absolutely boring to drive after a few months. Yes I strongly considered the Subaru Outback as an alternative but find the current generation model bloated-looking and do not like the Lineartronic CVT transmission. My Alltrack is fully loaded and I enjoy the styling and especially the lighting option that sets the car apart.  Acceleration transmission and road-feel are all very good definitely a step-up from the Jetta Sportwagen TDI. I do primarily city driving and I'm averaging 21 mpg (my diesel averaged 25 mpg city driving). On the highway I've averaged 33 mpg. I did have issues with the compass which impacted the NAV (factory re-call) and the lane assist program functions both repaired under warranty. I love wagons but here in the US options are limited to Subaru Audi Mercedes BMW and Volvo the 4 latter models being significantly higher priced. As far as I'm concerned the VW Golf Alltrack SEL with the driver assistance and lighting option package is a very similar wagon to the Audi Allroad makes sense since they share many of the same parts. Also the Audi Allroad runs on premium while the VW Alltrack runs on regular gas. To sum I really love this wagon and just waiting for some Chicago snow to test the 4-Motion AWD!,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,22-01-2017,Q1 2017,0.5984,5,Two wishes: tighter steering although there is much to be said for the nimble nature of the current set-up.               Also versus my 2012 Jetta TDI I have lost around 29 lb-ft torque.                                         Enter the GLI horse power enter my grin and the clamouring for the lost torque is a long distant memory (sort of like the car that could have been behind me just a second ago). ,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,23-01-2017,Q1 2017,0.8588,5," My Autobahn: leather/heat/power seat DCC Nav and ACC/Blind Spot/Cross Traffic safety features. Got an amazing year-end deal that I could not pass so I will return my VW TDI earlier than plan.  1k miles total so far in 2 weeks.  During past GTI test drives I always thought the ride was a bit stiff so I decided to get the Autobahn with DCC.  That way I can turn the suspension to a softer mode (""comfort"") when needed.   Funny after 2 weeks I now prefer ""sport"" mode over regular ""normal"" or ""comfort"" mode.  The GTI MK7 engine is very smooth as it happily rev up to its red line.  Combined with its lightweight the GTI can quickly and easily pass other cars at highway speed.   You can get speeding ticket(s) if you are not careful with this car as it goes from 60 to 80 mph in no time.  It makes me wonder what APR stage 1 or 2 mod will turn this car into ?  As a manual trans driver in the past I found the DSG pretty amazing on any street at any speed.  I don't understand all of GTI DSG complaints out there.  Nobody can shift the transmission as fast and smooth aggressive when needed than this smartly engineered DSG.  The DSG in my 2013 TDI is good this one is GREAT.  As advertised GTI returns 29 mpg combined.  I am very happy with its safety features they are excellent and work as designed.   The bad news ?  quality control is poor for a $36k list car.  Back window does not roll up/down driver door ambient light does not work back seat bench still have wrapping plastic protrude out from its bottom and worse the infotainment system with Nav broke (known issue) after three days - new unit is in ordered.  Even though CR predicts below reliability I'd expected better quality control after almost 2 year of Golf/GTI production in Mexico very disappointed.   My GTI issues are being fixed under warranty.  I gave VW GTI 5 stars mostly due to its interior luxury feel (very close to Audi BMW or Mercedes level) its Ultimate Driving Machine characteristics and its steep year-end discount.  Aside from the quality control annoyances  I have my grin every day driving this GTI.",,,,

Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,03/12/2017,Q1 2017,0.5106,5, I thoroughly researched the midsize seGM Motor Corpent and found the Passat to be a perfect fit for me.  I live in metro Phoenix so opted for the S trim since I'm not a fan of leatherette seats in our intense summer heat.  The base model has plenty of standard features and I was able to purchase a new one for $18800.  I love the fit and finish of the vehicle with its accompanying handsome understated design and you'd be hard-pressed to find a comparable sedan for under 19K.  I've owned all type of cars from different manufacturers but this is my first VW and I am very pleased.  I highly recommend the Passat.,,,,

Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,16-03-2017,Q1 2017,0.9859,4, Quite a car for the money.  The 1.8T engine is peppy if not strong and smooth like a V6.  Two great fun options are the Tiptronic shifting and the Sport mode for the 6-speed transmission.  This car has a lot of technology and is fun to operate.  There is no native Navigation but there is interface to the iPhone and Android which is actually better than Navi because you are using your own phone which you know backwards and forwards.  All the features are projected to the large info screen on the dash.  This saves a good $1500-2000 from the MSRP.  First day I had 3 adult passengers for a trip to a baseball game with two six-footers in the back who raved about the roominess and the ride.  Gas mileage looks like as advertised.  Happy with this car.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,19-03-2017,Q1 2017,0.3064,5," After owning a 2006 Honda Motor Corp Accord V6 EXL with NAV for the past 5 years I was a little nervous about going with a VW with a 4 cylinder Engine; especially after having my mind set on getting a 14 Accord EXL V6. After about 4 months of research and 1 step in the Passat I knew this was the car for me. The VW Passat in my opinion is a totally different experience than what you expect with other brands. The VW Passat is classy solid and a true drivers car. The 1.8 tsi is peppy and an absolute blast to drive engine; I find myself having a lot more fun than I did driving with my V6. I even got 40 MPG on the freeway going 65 mph with the AC on. The controls are simple to use and everything feels like it's in the right place. The steering wheel is comfortable and doesn't take a long time getting used to. I opted for the lighting package which takes this car to an Audi level. I get lots of looks during the day thanks to the DRL LED strip. The 3 stage seat warmers are awesome and the seats are pretty comfortable. I am a tall guy and I absolutely love the room in this car I just turned 26 and wanted to get an ""adults"" car since I will be owning this car in my 30's. I feel very happy and confident in my decision to buy a new VW Passat. This car is surely to give me many years of reliability and fun. I know VW may have had some issues and people have a bad taste in thier mouth about VW but I have owned 3 Honda Motor Corps and it wasn't always as reliable as the  perception would lead you to believe. I take great care of my cars and only use dealers. I put shell v power in my cars and do scheduled maintenance on time and still had issues with my accord's. I believe with maintaing my VW as I should it will prove to be just as dependable. If your considering Honda Motor Corp Toyota Motor Corp Nissan Motor Corp etc.. put the Passat SE with lighting on your list. One step in the VW will show you how a car should be built. Plus I got a $28010 dollar car for $22500!!! It was a no branienr.",,,,

Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,27-03-2017,Q1 2017,0.9134,5, I rated acceleration 4 of 5 not cuz it's slow (it's actually really quick) but because there is a bit of turbo lag.  But once you get the swing of how to work with it with the manual trans it's not a problem.  This car is so solid confidence-inspiring and neutral feeling yet it feels ready to play at all times.  And it's an absolute monster on twisty roads.  All that and it's as sedate of a cruiser as you like when you want it to be.  Amazing all-arounder of a car.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,04/06/2017,Q2 2017,0.8682,4, A decent car except for the Japanese automatic transmission. I owned a 2009 and 2015 Jetta TDI with the DSG transmission and am extremely disappointed with the transmission in the 2017 Passat SE.  The upshift from 3 to 4 and the downshift from 5 to 4 are jerky and noisy unlike the DSG transmission of my two previous Jettas. The jerk and noise is especially noticeable when driving normally at the speed limits in small towns but not noticeable when accelerating more aggressively with the gas peddle when getting up to highway speed.  I would not buy this car if you love the smoothness of the DSG transmission in prior VW models.  None of the Passat SE models had DSG when I was buying and I did not notice the difference when test driving so I bought the car assuming that the 6-speed automatic Japanese transmission would be OK.  I was wrong.  The other minor annoyance is this car does not have park assist (which I don't care about) but I frequently get a notification on the screen that there is no park assist.  Why would I want to know this when I don't have it?  I will be trading in this car when VW decides to add DSG to the Passat SE line.  The only model that has DSG at this time is the gas guzzling Passat SEL and the tradeoff isn't worth paying royalties to oil companies that have inflated prices at a time of historically low demand for fuel.,,,,

Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,05/07/2017,Q2 2017,0.961,4, I've been driving an autobahn trim for the past four months. Overall I think this is a very good car for daily driving but it's far from perfect. The DCC in comfort mode does improve the ride quality significantly giving a firm but smooth ride around town. However the ride deteriorates at high speeds (70 to 75 mph) and becomes somewhat rough and bouncy. It wouldn't be my first choice if I was going on a long road trip. I think the blind spot monitor system is unsafe. The warning light comes on late and I can often see a vehicle in my blind spot before the light turns on. I do think the adaptive cruise control is useful and easy to operate. For everyday music listening the Fender system does not offer much more than the lower level 8 speaker system. For comparison my daughter drives a golf sportwagen with a base sound system and I think it sounds just as good. For what it's worth my recommendation to VW is to offer both 17 inch and 18 inch wheels so drivers who want a more compliant ride can choose the smaller wheels. Also VW needs to work on their  blind spot detection system.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,13-05-2017,Q2 2017,0,5, VW got it right here. Amazing value.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,20-05-2017,Q2 2017,0.8922,5, Few of the other drivers on the road know what you have until you hit the gas. You'll get knowing looks from GTIs. A $50k car for half the price.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,22-05-2017,Q2 2017,-0.9221,5," Turned in my 2013 diesel TDI SE pursuant to the emissions fraud settlement and bought a gas powered 2017 SE 4cyl. with the proceeds.  Sweet riding and driving car. Well put together. If you liked the 2012-2016 Passat you will feel at home with the 2017 model. Not many changes. The gas powered Passat doesn't have the torqued up feel of the diesel version. The engine and transmission don't break speed down hill like the diesel version did. Consequently I anticipate that it will burn brakes faster than the earlier diesel versions. The standard 4cyl. 1.8 turbo powered engine has plenty of get up and go. However fuel economy is nowhere close to the earlier diesel versions. Unlike the diesel versions that got great mileage all the time mileage on the gas powered 2017 Passat tends to run in two modes: low to mid 20s in town and mid to high 30s on the interstate. Not much in between. However I think 40 mpg is possible on a long trip if the gasoline powered car is driven properly. My diesel TDI routinely got over 50 mpg on long trips.  VW decided to reduce the vertical opening of the front door entry way by about 1"". That was a terrible mistake. It may make the car look sportier but it makes it more difficult to get in and out of if you are 6'2"" tall or more. People don't buy a Passat to be sporty. No free maintenance program comes with this car.  It has a large back-up camera and blind spot warning sensors etc.. Stereo system Bluetooth and other electronic app functions work great. Same huge trunk. Heated front seats. AC system and controls have been enhanced.  LED lighting package is a worthwhile option. I am basically delighted with my 2017 Passat SE.  I hope it will prove to be a versatile and maintenance free car over time.",,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,26-05-2017,Q2 2017,0.9299,5, This is a fun car to drive. I purchase the SE with technology and this car is great. I disagree with Edmunds about the sluggish transmission NOT. Feels like a sport car and it competes with its rivals. It is loaded with technology and worth the price I paid $ 22671 after taxes ETC and trade in. Such a steal on the MSRP is $ 29375,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,13-06-2017,Q2 2017,0.926,5," I'm glad I waited for this model to come out.  I've owned a few VWs with the last one being a 2010 VW Golf 5 spd MT that was VERY reliable but lacked the 4 doors and storage space I needed for extracurricular activities (camping kayaking skiing).  I had cross-shopped Subarus to see what I might be missing and almost bought one for my last car but couldn't find a manual transmission anywhere and the newer ones have mostly phased them out for a CVT.  The outback was nice but when compared to the features I get with the Golf Alltrack and the manual transmission made it much more fun to drive!   Also cost a lot more for similar features.  Now to the alltrack... I just did a 1000 mile road trip and the car drives extremely smooth and when kept to about 70 mpg with a loaded car I was getting 35 mpg.  The car has a perfect amount of storage space.  The only negative would be the back seat is a little smaller than some others but still good for a 6'0"" person in the back as long as you don't try to put 5 people in the car.  It's really much better for 4.   For entertainment I can't get over how good CARPLAY is.  It makes the car so much more enjoyable to use when trying to do navigation listen/find music voice text etc...   I previously had installed a high end Kenwood GPS system in my last car but this is much better/easier to use.   To wrap it up the car handles very well is smooth on the highway and pretty quiet the entertainment system is easy to use and this is an overall great car.  I can't wait til' ski season to try out the 4 wheel drive in the snow but for the time being I'm just enjoying using the car and all it's features!",,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,21-06-2017,Q2 2017,0.4922,2, The car does not indicate what gear you are in until the clutch is fully disengaged and the car is moving.  You could be at a traffic signal thinking you are in 1st but really in 3rd and you would not know until the light turns green and you stall out.  Once stalled due to the car being push button start the driver must stomp on the brake quickly to restart the car.  By that time you've been rear-ended.  Thus button start is not compatible with a manual transmission.  The distracted driver electronics (i.e. driver assistance package) is also crap.   A 1/2 hr test drive in city traffic netted only 19.7 mpg.   No thanks  I'll keep my TDI.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,22-06-2017,Q2 2017,0.9955,4, We did the diesel buyback on our 2009 Sportwagen TDI so we needed a replacement. We selected the Alltrack because it is AWD and is available with a manual transmission. We don't care about the supposed off-road capabilities. But we do live in the Colorado mountains and don't like getting stuck in the snow. For that purpose this car is the perfect compromise because you don't give up good handling economy and comfort which is what you need over 95% of the time.  With the manual transmission we are averaging 29mpg and expect to get in the 30s on trips (Fuelly.com shows that the DSG (automatic) Alltracks average about 3-4 mpg less). The stereo capabilities are impressive. We opted for the S model due to the added level of road noise leaks and breakage we experienced with the panoramic sunroof on our 2009 Sportwagen. This is my first VW without a sunroof since 1983 and I have no regrets about not having the panoramic sunroof. The manual transmission is geared toward fuel economy rather than performance like  a GTI but it is still a pleasure to shift. Between hill hold optionally giving it the gas when starting to prevent stalling turning off the gas when coasting in gear and maintaining the cruise control when shifting shows that VW has carried manual transmissions to the next level. Our biggest gripe was that we were waiting for the manual Alltracks to arrive and we afraid they wouldn't show until after our buyback leaving us without a car. Luckily the new car showed up two weeks before the buyback.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,16-09-2016,Q3 2017,0.9859,3, I have had the car just a few days an all and all the car is impressive. However after coming out of my214 Ford Motor Corp Edge (42k)  To this car (50k) I feel that VW should've put a little thought into the tech package. I assumed this car was state of the art in tech. The car runs well but I already use google maps to get places. The voice recognition is HORRIBLE.  My 2014 Edge was light years ahead of VW on the Tech side.,,,,

Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,16-07-2017,Q3 2017,0.9598,5, To start off I would like to say my age 54.   My other vehicles are a 2016 Suzuki dual sport motorcycle and a 2014 Ram 3500 diesel 4x4.  I love all my vehicles.  My 2017 GTI  Sport with the millennial anti theft device (6 spd MT) is just fun to drive.  The little 4 banger has enough ponies to get you on and off the freeway in a hurry.  It is also a blast in the canyons of Southern Calif.    If you are mindful of your speed on the highway she will yield a good 34/35 MPG.   If you want to jump on it and have little fun the MPG do go down which is worth the bad fuel mileage.   The GTI is my weekend fun car.  I purchased it in Nov 2016 and I have been very happy.  People talk a lot of smack about VW reliability.  All I can say is all cars have their limitations.  If you drive your car like an idiot then be prepared for it to take an occasional dump on you.  I don't think you have to baby these vehicles but you can't be dropping the hammer every time you get behind the wheel.    I probably will do two mods to it in time.  Change the exhaust and air box.   From my previous vehicles (Harleys to trucks) changing their air intake makes a big difference in how they perform.  I'm sure this GTI will be the same.,,,,

Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,10/07/2016,Q4 2017,0.7003,5, This is my second Touareg after driving a 2005 into the ground.  Huge improvements in interior luxury/features and acceleration.  It's about the perfect car for my needs.  Big enough to fit my family of five comfortably though probably not for long drives.  Impressive interior with very high quality parts and styling with beautiful huge oversized sunroof - looks like the Porsche Cayenne it is based on at almost half the price.  Quick steady acceleration for such a heavy car and great ride...I've been sneaking up to 80 or 85 mph accidentally a few times because it rides so smoothly.  The two small issues are 1) no CD player (that is probably me resisting change) and 2) no USB port just bluetooth.  For the CD player there is a media port in the center console that I will try to plug in a portable CD player and see if that works - I'm not ready to retire all of my CDs or take the time to burn all of them to my iPhone.  For the USB I guess I can live with the Bluetooth but you'd think they could drop a USB in the center console. Time will tell on the maintenance and reliability since I've only had it two weeks... fingers crossed.  Otherwise this is an exceptional car that looks great feels great drives great and has about every feature you'd want.  Highly recommend.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,11/01/2016,Q4 2017,0.9925,5, The R-line has a beautiful sporty design compared to the base S model. The 19in aluminum alloy wheels are stylish and really grip the road allowing for great tight handling; and the R-line's cabin is quiet even with the larger tires. Combined MPG is higher than EPA estimates of city/hwy 23/34 I'm currently getting about 31.5 (half hwy half city). What makes the Passat R-line stand above it's competitors is it's technology and low price. The central info-entertainment system is far superior to it's competitors including the Camry Optima Legacy and Madza 6. Also it comes in a few thousand below the base prices of several of its competitors making it an afFord Motor Corpable yet very reliable option. As an added plus is the size of the cabin. It's huge compared to other midsize sedans. Overall very impressive for a vehicle in the low 20s.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,11/02/2016,Q4 2017,0.6369,5, What we paid for this model was only slightly higer than our 2001 Passart. However they cut back the warranty changed the dash lights to whiteish and it seems there are no drip edges over the doors we got a small puddle on the seat when we opened the doors in the rain. Otherwise the Tech option give you a bunch of toys! Even if some cost money like Car-net and XM radio. But the car overall is great with the tech stuff it makes the car fun and the handleing is totally German so is the quality. Everything fits perfectly! Oh they also cut out option choices you get the package of each model and that's it. If you want to cut out the Sat radio and get Park assist instead with a regular radio it's not gonna happen what's on the advertisements and the sticker is what you get. And as everywhere today there isn't much haggling on the price they have their sales and you get a little off that then they'll add in maintenance and paint protection and tir warranties and they get their full price. Then there was the SEL with lane departure and Park assist for only a couple thousand more!,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,11/02/2016,Q4 2017,0.6908,5, This car is hungry; truly in an almost uncivilized way...to be driven. The 210 hp TSI engine growls like it just wants more road to chew.                                                          The cornering is effortless and quick and the DSG gearing leaves cars in the rear view mirror at an alarming rate. ,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,11/02/2016,Q4 2017,0.9348,5, Simply best in its seGM Motor Corpent. Test driven many competitors but VW PASSAT definitely stands out. Excellent handling and brakes awesome road experience quality interior great infotainment system catchy design (I leased the R-Line model) and many more. Definitely recommend this car especially with current deals from Volkswagen Motor Corpwagen.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,11/09/2016,Q4 2017,-0.6249,5, The Jetta GLI is a fairy sporty sedan. It's not the most economical of the Jetta trim levels but offers great acceleration braking and handling. The interior is nice with a good infotainment system parking assistance and blind spot monitoring. I haven't had the car long enough to comment on reliability.,,,,

Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,15-11-2016,Q4 2017,0.9979,5, I had been looking for a new car for months and was thinking Audi or Lexus. I preferred German engineering over all else as I used to own a BMW 328i but decided to sell it before major repairs became a common place situation. I went to my local VW dealer and saw the R Line in Black and realized I preferred the look of this car over the new A4. Took it for a test drive and fell in love. I don't know how the specifications are so low on the engine 170 HP and 184 ft lb torque when it feels like it pulls like a much higher engine. I was extremely impressed by the package and with the incentive acquired the car for slightly over $22k. Insane value. After the past few days I am in love. It's quiet perky handles extremely well fuel efficient and beautiful to look at and sit in. I think VW really has a winner with this one. I look forward to owning this car for awhile.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,18-11-2016,Q4 2017,0.8832,5, I combined the Pilot insurance money with selling my Miata and now I'm set with a 2017 Jetta SE.  Jus the right size and great gas mileage.  Sanibel white with a sunroof and heat seats.  6-speed automatic gets me from point A to B in plenty of style.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,25-11-2016,Q4 2017,-0.471,5, I have owned many cars and none of them have been as fun to drive as the GTI.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,26-11-2016,Q4 2017,0.9784,5," I looked at the 2016 Passat and reviewed it so well my wife let me buy an E300 MB but I can explain. I got the 1989 GLI itch all over again so I purchased a silver 2017 GTI SE. Yep same stuff as the Passat except in a SPORT verses luxury bent platform. I didn't want another E300 but a car that excelled at the opposite end of the car spectrum. I had to have a car that was as economical good or better at hauling stuff more fun to drive and had a better stereo than my 2008 Focus SE. Slam dunk with the GTI. The E300 drives you you drive the GTI 6 speed manual (shifts like butter spreads on a warm day). I can't wait to DRIVE this car same as the 1989 GLI! Something about VW handling that is addictive. The engine is a sweet thing. At idle it simply goes away on you nothing not a quiver. But give it the gas and it talks really nice things to you shift me now. Power with the manual is electric motor linear and STRONG. The front limited slip differential drive system keeps both wheels pulling in snow wet or dry with excellent throttle modulation. The engine is a tiger or a pussycat. Drive it like the 2008 Focus and I get 38-45.5 MPG. Yep same 34 mile route each way as before with the Focus. Drive it like hard like a sports car and still get 28 MPG. The best way to explain this car is that all the pieces are seemingly of the exact same quality level. Nothing irks you to say ""wow that's seems cheap"". OK except that the rear view mirror should be auto dimming weird it isn't. The odometer goes away when you set the cruise as the set speed takes its place weird but not a problem. The instruments are clear and a German conservative white on black LCD illustration. I like it that way too. Everything ergonomically falls right into your hands. I will also say that the interior of the SE NEEDS those Clark Cloth plaid seats or something other than red stitching and a few red lighting accents big time. I am not a fan of black interiors but it is a good black interior. Still give us a two-tone option PLEASE. Oh the seats are superlative for my 155 LBS frame. BIG guys may want to try before you buy. I needed the stereo (OK wanted) and a few other bits I know would make long term ownership nice (ya I paid cash for it).  This is a sports car so the ride is heavenly responsive to the road without being harsh. If you think it rides harshly this isn't your car or any other sport type car. For a sports car it is sublime. Not only does it go really well with near no lag in the turbo (I have the manual so I can drive around it without thinking) or torque steer (the 1989 GLI had PLENTY of that) but it STOPS like NOW with the R series brakes. The green house is WONDERFUL old school lower belt line like the Passat...so you can SEE yet it has five star safety ratings. Bi-Xenon lights are very good not the LED's on the E300 though but way over average. The entertainment is just like my Passat review. It is fast and easy to use with the jump buttons on the side and 100% intuitive touch from there. I've never felt it to be slow or unresponsive. I use a 128GB SD card with WAV file music and the USB for the phone and carplay apps and navigation.  I'm smitten with the overall assembly of this car. OK now the negatives. This is maybe the third EA888 engine iteration. Fixed are the cam chain tensioner issues. Left are likely the longer term carbon on the intake valves common to DI injection engines (no fuel across the intakes to clean them anymore) so a 80000 mile cleaning is in the cards. Not a deal breaker as it is cheaper(~$800.00) to do than a rubber belt cam chain maintenance interval. The PCV valve can fail (this is the latest version that is again supposed to work) and pressurize the crankcase (rear crank seal goes) or pulls a vacuum (oil is pulled through the intake). Turbo engines can be hell on the PCV valve with the boost pressure. But this is a $200.00 part and an easy hour in the garage to fix at 50000 miles. Fix it like an airplane BEFORE it fails. So I'll replace the PCV valve every 50000 and not ever know the original one would have lasted the life of the car. Pity me but it is cheap insurance. Otherwise this engine is to die for. This is a poor excuse for a mid life crisis car it is way too afFord Motor Corpable way too practical way too sublimely sexy in appearance and yet still way too much fun. Count me in. The GTI is still the best I drove the rest.",,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,27-11-2016,Q4 2017,0.6369,5, I recently leased a 2017 Passat R-Line and I have to say I am surprised by how good it is.  I'm pretty OCD and normally take a long time and make careful decisions.  I cross-shopped it with other mid-size sedans mainly the Honda Motor Corp Accord Toyota Motor Corp Camry Kia Optima Hyundai Sonata Chevrolet Malibu and Ford Motor Corp Fusion.  Basically I rented or test drove all the main mid-sizers except the Subaru Legacy.  In terms of handling the Passat is middling.  It is a bit bouncy and feels just a bit floaty at high speeds (over 80 mph which is normal speed on SoCal freeways when not congested).  Of all of them the best driving were the Mazda 6 Ford Motor Corp Fusion and Honda Motor Corp Accord followed by the Malibu Optima and Passat with the Sonata bringing up the rear.  In terms of comfort however by far the most comfortable was the Passat both for the front seats and especially the crazy large backseats.  It also feels very airy and the sight lines are very good (except to the direct rear where high back headrests intrude a little).  The little 1.8 liter turbo engine is a champ.  It felt at least as powerful as the base engines in the other mid-sizers and more powerful than some.  Yeah its 170 horsepower doesn't sound very impressive but its 184 lb ft of torque is always there and gives really good oomph.  I will check mpg when I've had it for longer.  In terms of technology and infotainment I would say the Passat ranks pretty well but is not the best.  The R-Line has the key safety features I was looking for:  Wide angle rear camera rear cross-traffic alert blind spot monitor and forward collision alert with emergency braking.  The one feature it is missing which I wanted was adaptive cruise control - I would have needed to go up to the SE With Technology for that (I think Edmunds lists it in the normal SE which seems to be a rare error by Edmunds).  One possible safety issue:  The headlights aren't the best.  I have the halogens - the LED headlights are supposed to be a bit better but mine doesn't have them.  I can see fine with the halogens but they aren't very bright and some people might wish for more brightness.  In terms of looks I would say the Passat is attractive from all angles especially the back and side although I think looks are really a matter of personal taste.  Trunk space is very good - 15.9 cubic feet and the space is very functional plus the rear seats fold down 60/40.  The main reason I chose the Passat was that looked at as a whole package I felt better about it than any of the others.  It just feels extremely easy to live with and also feels like a premium car but at a lower price than others on this list.  There is nothing it doesn't do well and some things it does great (did I mention the huge open airy comfortable cabin?  Let me mention it again).  Plus the dealership (Mossy VW in Escondido CA) was more willing to work with me than other dealers.  So I drove off with what I felt was the best car of the bunch at the lowest price of the bunch what's not to like?  It's too new to give any reliability impressions - I might do that after I've had more time with the car.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,29-11-2016,Q4 2017,0.9863,5, I really enjoy driving this car very precise. Not the flashiest car in the seGM Motor Corpent but to me it is about function and feel not fashion.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,30-11-2016,Q4 2017,0.2247,5, I have owned a number of GTIs but have to say this is probably the best one ever. The sport is a stand alone model that includes the performance pack Nogaro alloys (Only on Sport model) bi-xenon/LED lighting keyless entry/ignition over the base S model. Plus Apple play is a great feature negating the need for navigation. For me and I am sure other enthusiasts agree that this is the perfect model - why? The new MQB platform GTI is a an incredibly well-developed car that drives and handles superbly. The Sport has all the essentials needed without the superfluous toys added in the SE and Autobahn models - this is the enthusiasts GTI. The addition of the Performance packs adds some extra horsepower but the real bonus of the package is the mechanical limited slip differential which takes cornering on a front-drive car to a new level and the stopping power of the R brake package. The beauty of the GTI has always been the fact that it is such a versatile and well-behaved car when you want it to be but when you want to push it to it limits it is in an even happier mode. I love the fact that this car is so capable in so many areas - it may well be the perfect car!,,,,

It is the nicest riding and handling auto I have driven in my 30 years in the business.Ithas great interior room and a giant trunk.The seats have piping on that make the interior look much more expensive then it is.It feels rock solid and almost gets hybrid fuel economy .The dealer has drawings for dinners and details.

Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,29-05-2017,Q2 2017,0.9659,5," My wife and I had been looking for a new SUV for the last few months.  I'm a pretty big guy at 6'2"" and about 245lbs so spaciousness is a big concern for me.  After driving the pathfinder highlander 4 runner and pilot nothing compared to the space I have in the Atlas.   It's a very comfortable ride and has great features that I've never had in a car before.  The lane assist park assist and ACC work awesome but take a bit of getting used to.   The sound system sounds great even without the top of the line Fender system.  In addition the apple car play interface works great!   My only concern with it is that it doesn't seem to let you search for specific sounds in iTunes unless you have it in a playlist.  I may be wrong on this as I've just began to play with it.   All in all we have been very happy with the car so far.   Time will see how well it's reliability holds up but with VWs 72000 mile warranty on this car we figured it was well worth a try.",,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,06/05/2017,Q2 2017,0.9688,5, I just purchased my Atlas about two weeks ago. I love the size of the vehicle and for its size it handles nicely. If I put it in sport mode acceleration is lively and adequate. In normal mode acceleration is fine. The technology for the adaptive cruise control and lane keeping is amazing and although it took me a few weeks to figure everything out it never ceases to amaze. The parking assist features work nicely as well. I use it for commuting in Houston and hauling the family around on weekends. Can't wait to take it on a long road trip. I would highly recommend this vehicle.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,17-06-2017,Q2 2017,0.7964,2, Wtf this vehicles technology is junk. How can they possible consider it a technology edition when doesn't even come with a  garage door opener. I am a andriod user and expect the technology to blend seamlessly however this is not the case.  I am still waiting for manufactures to give up on their proprietary software and use opensource so the professionals can give the people exactly what they want. What I want is a display that mirrors my phone exactly is that too much to ask. I have this in my 2006 Toyota Motor Corp solara it can be done. This is my first day owning this vehicle that makes my KIA Optima look like a Lexus. The interior is barebones sure it has leather and holds 8 people but I think I would have enjoyed a Buick Enclave more. Now I have 3 yrs of lease on a genaric POS. I had high hopes and now believe I made a huge mistake.,,,,
Volkswagen Motor Corp,2017,19-06-2017,Q2 2017,0.9865,4, First I love this car it's comfort style and maneuverability.  It fits my kids and I perfectly and we have really enjoyed it.  I also have nothing but great things to say about everyone we have come in contact with at VW.  They all have been very helpful.  I am however extremely disappointed in the fact that our car has been in the service department twice already.  The first time was for loose bolts on the sway bar which caused extreme front in knocking/grinding sounds and rough handling.  The second time was for a check engine light that came on.  The diagnostic report stated that it had something to do with an air leak to the engine.  Currently it is at the dealership for this and I don't have more information yet.  I was hesitant to write this review as I generally don't like to comment with negative feedback but thought it would be worthwhile if it helps someone else in making their decision when purchasing a car.  My dad purchased this car for us with the hopes that my kids and I would be driving something reliable and safe and unfortunately so far that has not proved to be true.  I'm very bummed out about our purchase for this reason.,,,,
